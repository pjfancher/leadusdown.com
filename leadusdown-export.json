And just as his music and lyrics imply�it�s made for everyone.</p> <p>If you�re new in town and are looking for some solid entertainment with a little taste of what this city�s is like from a local�s point of view, check out D.P. for his record release show this Friday, Sept. 6 at the High Dive. He�ll be joined by Marley The Messenger &amp; DJ Robzilla, The High Bohemians and False Flag.</p> <p><strong>- Ale Gasso</strong></p>",

It�s like when you hit your bent knee with a mallet or that sinking feeling you get when the stagediver is about to land on you�it�s  a reaction, you can't help it. So it takes time and separation to figure out which records truly are the �good� ones. For me Less Than Jake�s <em>Hello Rockview</em> is their strongest work. Maybe it was the time I heard it, or seeing them play a bunch around then, but this was the LTJ record that both Dave and I circled when we started this show. I think the only thing faster than the frenetic pace of the music is Buddy's bubbling enthusiasm when talking\r\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3079px; top:-3168px;\">With smell Unfortunately.

The authors delve into their first experiences hearing the influential Gainesville band�s music and what it means to them today. It�s a fun read that pulls apart some of Radon�s lyrics and adds context to their active days of playing shows in Gainesville. I sat down with Travis a while back to chat about the book and about Radon. We talked about everything else as well, so this interview has been edited down a bit for length and staying-on-topicness. You can pick up a copy of <em>Radon</em> at <a href=\"http://www.noidearecords.com/catalog/?letter=R\" target=\"_blank\">No Idea Records</a> or look for it in independent book stores.</p>\r\\n<p><em>Radon is playing at Boca Fiesta this Saturday. It's a benefit to help cover costs associated with heart surgery for drummer Bill Clower's daughter. Not to be missed!

This happened over a good number of years. So, I said, �Aaron why don�t you just write a book about Radon?� And he responded, �No, I think <em>you</em> should write a book about Radon.� Then, finally, I said, �Ok, let�s each write about Radon.�</p>\r\\n<p>I had a very different idea about the project. Particularly about interviewing the band. He immediately said no. No band, particularly Radon can�t see themselves objectively. That was his logic. Understandable. Same with objectivity.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>What was your idea in interviewing them? Was it going to be more of a biographical type thing?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>My idea was loose, amorphous. My memories of seeing Radon are vivid. My ideal interview is to sit down with them with the list of rumors.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>How did it come into this book form, the <em>45 rpm</em> series?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Aaron makes <em>Cometbus </em>(his own very successful fanzine that he self-publishes). He has a printer that he likes in New York. The book makes a Radon type of sense. And isn't an official part of the 33 1/3 book series. Just as Radon occupies a funny space in punk and Gainesville history. Their record is a 45, not a 33, so both are much shorter. The John Darnielle one (in the <em>33 1/3</em> series) about Black Sabbath�s <em>Master of Reality</em> is perfect. I will say that.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I haven�t read them, I actually didn�t know about them until I saw that this was kind of a parody of the <em>33 1/3</em> in a way.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Parody, homage, just a design format�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Yeah, I mean loose, not like a scathing type parody.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Hopefully covered under copyright laws!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Were you somewhat concerned about infringement or something?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I had a little more anxiety because I used my legal name. It seems far-fetched, but who knows? I was more worried that any Radon member (or anyone mentioned in the book) would be angry about something one of us had written.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I didn�t see anything too inflammatory.</strong> <strong>Did you see them here a lot? (I interviewed Travis at Boca Fiesta, which used to be the Hardback in Radon�s active days.)</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I did. Here and at the old Covered Dish. There was another band, Spoke, from the same time. They were the only two bands that I really knew and followed. I thought, in a ridiculous, inexperienced way, that these guys were in <em>bands</em>. Now everyone�s in five bands. Nothing against that! But back then, even the idea of going to Miami to play a show was mind-blowing.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You said the Fest changed Gainesville�s parameters of what local bands might expect and what success entailed. Did bands expect anything then? Do they now?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>This was also when No Idea was in Var�s living room. There were big parties to stuff 7�s into the zines. None of it could ever felt like it could evolve into a job. Even something like the success of Nirvana and Green Day felt like a fluke.</p>\r\\n<p>Now we�re on FEST 10 or 11? People know Gainesville because of the FEST. Even though there�s a million other bands doing different stuff.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You said that you moved to Gainesville when you were 17, was that for college? </strong></p>\r\\n<p>It was, nothing special. I didn�t graduate early or anything. All-ages shows were a big deal. Spoke and Radon played those sort of shows, so that was really encouraging. When I moved here the bands were grungy and Melvins-esque. Scary older dudes.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I was talking to Var for an article a while back and he kind of talked about that. He said that he was a certain age in Gainesville, he liked to go to shows, but he was too young for the crowd that was the scene in the late �80s and then when Spoke and Radon happened he was their age, so he was like, �Whoa, these guys are awesome.�</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Exactly! Everything changed. A groundswell. Most people here graduate and move away. With the Radon record -- their songs are so enmeshed with those shows that I thought the record couldn�t hold up. Actually, before Aaron and I started the book, I was a little worried about listening to the record! But, no, it�s so much better than I remembered. So much richer.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Do you have a favorite Radon song?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Aaron completed his essay first and wrote about �Grandma�s Cootie.� That song stuck with me, then and now. The idea of this grandmother on the rollercoaster! How can you have a chorus that champions things like loneliness and death? And to make it � and sorry if I sound like a bad version of myself in the book � but Radon somehow make the scene sound triumphant. Then the further layers of listening to the record alone instead of with a room full of dancing maniacs. To answer your question, I�d say that �Science Fiction� is my favorite Radon song. I likely focused on Dave�s songs over Brent�s in the book, so I�m\r\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; left:-2762px; top:-3713px;\">Light .

Not out of a conscious boycott, but in the intervening years, I worked at Wayward Council record store for 10-plus years. I worked at No Idea. And I would buy records every time I went on tour, so the number of records that grew around the Radon LP turned into shelves upon shelves.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>In the back of the book it says you play in Reactionary 4 but I thought the name of your band was Reactionary 3.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>It is, but we always joked that our friend Mary (from Little Rock who always took us on tour in her van) was the fourth member. None of Aaron�s bands are real either� My friend Caroline, when she saw the back of the back, was like, I don�t get any of this, is this whole thing a joke?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Ha, did it throw off your credibility?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I didn�t know how to answer that. It just seemed the only appropriate response to Aaron�s bio.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You mentioned going on tour.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Reactionary 3 did a bunch of tours and that was great. I went with Fiya a few times, including a great summer with Against Me! that was lovely. Then we met up with them again on a Reactionary 3 Euro tour.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Who played in Reactionary 3 with you?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Ryan Quinney who bartenders here. He drummed in Fiya and now in Holopaw (and Careeners) and then Mikey Stoltz who�s in film school in LA now.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You�re playing in die hoffnung now?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I am. They�ve always been one of my favorite bands � any of Jim and Jon�s (Marburger) bands. They asked me a couple of years ago to join. Since they�re siblings who�ve played together for many, many years, I was a little worried, but it�s going really well. They�re both working parents so we�re on a different schedule but I still love it.<strong></strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Some of the things that you mentioned in the book kind of reflect and compliment the quirkiness in Radon�s lyrics about Florida. You mentioned sinkholes, right after I read the book was when that huge sinkhole swallowed a man (in Tampa).</strong></p>\r\\n<p>That was harrowing.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I know, it�s awful. You also wrote a word I don�t think I�ve seen before that I had to look up.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Uh-oh.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Do you know what it is? Do you remember using some 100 dollar words?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I use a lot of pretentious words. I�m an English major.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>It was mondegreens.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Oh, I�m gonna take no credit. There�s a local band, Nervous Systems, with a song called �Mondegreens.� Joe explained to me that mondegreens are misheard rock lyrics.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>And you had one in here! �Away from big Doritos and banditos.�</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Yep. Wendy, Dave�s wife, busted me on that. It�s actually �big egos.� It wasn�t intentional, that�s how I always heard it.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Were there any other ones that you�ve discovered?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>No. Neither Bill, Dave, or Brent (or even Jeff London) have said, �you got it really wrong,� which I�m grateful for. Thanks, guys!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Obviously Dave and Bill were at the book release event; have you heard from those guys since they�ve had a chance to read it?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I reached out to Brent and Jeff London just to make sure they had a copy of the book. That stuff seems so important. It�s weird enough mentioning someone in a book, but to make sure that you give them a copy, just seems basic journalistic ethics.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You mentioned Jeff London and I assume that�s the Jeff you referred to here in the book, and is that the Jeff who is on the cover?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Yes.

What is his involvement or relationship with Radon? I assumed they know each other, but you said it like he�s a deeper�</strong></p>\r\\n<p>He was always at the shows, he always had the mic, he�s the one who explained different aspects of Radon to me, and I guess he collaborated on some of the lyrics. So, in that way, that seems significant. I never saw him play music with them, but inevitably within any band there are people heavily linked.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>And King Friday has a song called �I Wish I Was in Radon.� Have you heard that?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I don�t know that I have, but�wow.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>It�s on the last album that came out a few years ago, it�s a funny song.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I bet. Jeff�s a hell of a lyric writer.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>It�s good. They have a deeper connection than I knew then. Who�s Pablo?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Pablo�s a good friend. He�s also from South Florida but a bit younger. That really is him on the cover, shirking. Pablo also plays in Nervous Systems. When the Radon record came out, I was like, �Pablo, you�re on the cover!� And he said, �I was so scared I was going to get hit with that mic!�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>That�s hilarious. </strong></p>\r\\n<p>It�s a small book (44 pages), but there was a significant section in my essay where I did visual analysis of the pictures. But in Aaron and I going back and forth editing, he was like, �Man, no no no!� Would that have made any difference? I don�t know.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You talked about in the song �Radon� about the �bad things� and likened it to a horror movie. I�ve kind of gotten that from a few of their songs. It�s not outright, but it�s almost like a horror show on the verge of some kind of sinister vibe.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>To me, it touches on two things. Horror movies and poetry, I think both depend on a mystery and lurking things. Dark shadows, or hints of dread. And also open interpretation, things so horrible that you can only talk about them in these weird ways.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>That might be what it is, questions presented that aren�t answered. The lyrics and imagery in �Facial Disobedience,� are so bizarre, in my interpretation anyway, it�s like an early Tim Burton movie.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>It is! The backdrop of the first Iraq war is important to factor. At least for me and my friends, in order to get financial aid we had to sign up for selective service, so we were like, �Damn, if we get called up are we going to go or are we going to let the other people fight.� I knew I wanted to stay in Gainesville and see Radon! I don�t want to go die somewhere in a pointless war.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You said your part of the book could have easily been about a few other bands.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Sure.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I don�t know don martin 3.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>That�s likely a wingnut theory I have of like generations of bands and genealogy. First was Spoke and Radon, then Palatka and Don Martin 3, who were from St. Augustine. They played here often and only released one 7� and one 12�. When I went to London to work in a library, the first show I went to someone was like, �You�re from Gainesville, what do you know about don martin 3?� They�re not even a Gainesville band. But there are no real pictures on their records. To some people their record is way too emotionally raw, but there�s a lot of true believers out there who still feel it. They, much like Radon, went on one bad luck tour.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>What happened with the Radon tour? I�ve heard about as much as you said in your book about that tour where they got in an accident, I�ve heard about that much before and that�s it. Like you said, nobody talks about it.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>There was a time, as I mentioned, when I wanted to ask, but that�s not part of the book. Matt (Sweeting) knows some things.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>He might have been the one who mentioned it to me in passing.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I heard someone was hurt and I knew that they were going to play with Archers of Loaf. Those are the things that stuck with me. Would the band have stopped anyway? Was this their one shot at fame? All that�s like fantasy baseball, some speculation that doesn�t mean much in the present.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Yeah. That kind of stuff is kind of fun in a way to have a little bit of myth and questions around bands.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Sure, at the library we had cartoonist John Porcellino visit. We started talking about the Replacements and he�s from the Midwest. He swears that Paul Westerberg encouraged Bob Stinson�s drinking. I�m like, �I�ve never heard that, it�s got to be a myth.� But maybe it�s true, you�re never going to parse that.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You said you�d like to do more of this stuff in the future. Do you think you would do more of these? </strong></p>\r\\n<p>I did really mean if there�s another co-author that wanted to do it, that I would love to write about any of those albums mentioned at the end of the book.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Since this has been published, do you have any regrets like, �I wish I had mentioned that,� or, �I wish I had said this differently,� or anything like that?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>No. It�s funny, I hear my friends that draw comics say they work so hard and so long on something and then somebody can read it in an hour. Now I understand! Or the time it takes to make and produce an album, and then anyone can listen to it as you cook some pasta. So, seeing how small the book is doesn�t correspond in my mind (with the amount of work). No regrets!</p>\r\\n<p><em>Interview by Matt Walker, photo by Amy Trachtman</em></p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Damn.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>Fun Fact: When I heard Jeff Hanneman passed away, Slayer was playing on my iTunes. Last night, I was listening to a Rymodee song. It finished, and iTunes began to play the next file alphabetically, �Hallowed Point� from Slayer�s Decade Of Aggression 2xCD I bought off Uri when he has in town with Bad Tat. (Uri has my 2nd favorite Slayer tattoo). The only way I can connect Jeff Hanneman to Gainesville music: George Rebelo was in the crowd during the recording of Decade of Aggression.</p>\r\\n<p>I always think of dead rockers as if they have a problem I could avoid. Heroin, Pussy, Booze, Glamour, whatever. Jeff Hanneman never portrayed any of those. In Slayer, he was the guy who wrote the songs about war and crippling governments, Kerry wrote about religion.</p>\r\\n<p>Jeff must have a songbook full of ideas from the hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay to the rising awareness of American workers wanting safety in Bangladesh factories. Even an easy song about the 10 year anniversary of the U.S. Navy stopping tests in Vieques, Puerto Rico.</p>\r\\n<p>I giggle now thinking about him wearing\r\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3061px; top:-3066px;\">Little best.

That morning I walked from Simpson Hall to some intro class at Turlington Hall. My walkman was blaring a 90 minute cassette that included The Crew. With poetic timing, the tape died, as cassettes with years of use will do. I spent the remainder of that walk to class pondering youth and adulthood. This interview was conducted 18 years and 6 weeks after that cassette died.<!--more--></p> </p></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div>Letting Kevin talk about this album was easy. The hard part was holding my tongue. I could babble on at length (See above paragraph) about every song on this record and how they have had an impact on my life, or at least can relate an amusing/embarrassing story from my youth. Preparing for this interview was me training myself to keep my boring stories to myself. If any of you listeners want to hear me prattle on, pour me a cup of coffee and put this record on. For now, listen to Kevin. His stories are much more relevant to the actual songs.</div> <p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F86144481\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\"></iframe></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2013/04/the-top-shelf-presents-7-seconds-the-crew/7-seconds-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2724\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2724\" title=\"7 seconds\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/7-seconds.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a></p> <p><strong>About The Top Shelf</strong><br /> Dave Drobach and Matt Sweeting can talk about records. They have experience that can only come from combined decades of touring in numerous bands and working at a record label. No Idea�s finest bring in the creators of great albums we have all come to love, to sit down, reflect and reminisce on these recordings.</p> <p>There are three pieces to a Top Shelf interview.

Ex-Boogeymen front man, Reverend Liaison, was kind enough to not only answer a few questions about the album, but to keep his pants on as well.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Tell me, how did Ex-Boogeymen first cross paths with Waylon Thornton and the Heavy Hands?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I first met Waylon at the now-defunct Kickstand venue in Gainesville, Florida, during day two of the Trash Bash in 2009, which both our bands played. He was working the door this particular evening, so I introduced myself. Then the band on stage started playing �Stronger than Dirt,� by the Mummies, and in mid-conversation he sprang on stage and sang the whole damn song. I thought he was pretty tough. That was until I met his wife, Meg.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2013/02/rev-liaison-on-the-ex-boogeymens-new-split-with-waylon-thornton-both-playing-atlantic-tonight/wthh-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2662\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2662\" title=\"WTHH\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WTHH1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"598\" /></a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Were Waylon and Meg concerned about having Ex-Boogeymen come to record at their home, what with your reputation as being crazed and unruly?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I believe you�re referring to the drunken Ex-Boogeymen Buzz 100.5 radio interview where we were escorted out of the building and asked to issue an apology to the station, correct?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>That one definitely comes to mind.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Well, see, we�d made the mistake of bringing Troy Perlman (Whiskey &amp; Co. bassist) with us to that interview. He riled everyone up, especially (Ex-Boogeymen bassist) Leviticus who threw a half-full can of beer at him in the studio. We knew it was a bad sign when we were late to the interview after having pulled into the wrong station; we, for some reason, had rolled up into, like, Kiss Country. So anyway, later, after being asked to leave the Buzz building, Troy loses his car keys. So he�s pissed and throwing shit from out of his car into the Buzz parking lot� pizza boxes, empty Natural Lite cans, who knows? The staff are looking at us threw the blinds, wondering what the hell we were doing. It was bad. We thought our friend Lindsey, who interviewed us, was going to get fired. She didn�t, thankfully. So anyway Troy finds his keys� but he�s too messed up to drive so we literally wrestle them from him. Then, on the way back, he tries jumping out of the car� while it�s moving. Mercy and I had to restrain him. But, yeah, I could see where Meg and Waylon would be worried, what with them having a child.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>It all went smooth, then?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Well, nothing goes smooth as far as the Ex-Boogeymen�s concerned. We recorded two days and were late two days. But Sister Mary Mo and her girlfriend, Kaylaa, did enjoy Waylon and Meg�s horses, as did my girl, Christia. And Leviticus was curious about Meg�s extensive bible collection. I�ll tell you� It�s like <em>Dead Poets Society</em> meets Pee Wee�s Playhouse up in there. But on a farm. With drums and guitars. It�s amazing.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Some of the songs on <em>Only Darkness Holds the Power</em> stray significantly from the usual stuff you guys have done. How do you think people will react?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Well, for us, it�s not too much of a departure. It�s grittier and there is a lot more reverb; it�s sopping with it. But there is some crazy Waylon stuff there. �Grundy�s Night� is a real shit-kicker, whereas �Baron Samedi� reminds me of PiL. Goth as hell. People will love it, if they know what�s good for them.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Being that Waylon produced <em>Only Darkness Holds the Power</em>, how do you think his touch differs from that of Rob McGregor�s, who produced your last album, <em>Masters of Ceremony</em>?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Like I said, it�s much rawer. We recorded the bass and drums on one track, which was either brilliant or stupid, I can�t tell. I like it very much. But I also liked McGregor�s style. His sound is much cleaner, and we had a bit more time to fuss around. Recording with Waylon was fast and furious. There wasn�t a lot of time, so there�s definitely some urgency in the performance.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>So what exactly <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3043px; top:-3713px;\">Really scrub of will <a href=\"http://www.nutrapharmco.com/metmorfin-500mg-for-sale/\">http://www.nutrapharmco.com/metmorfin-500mg-for-sale/</a> was Let give <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nutrapharmco.com/where-can-i-buy-cyctotce-online/\">http://www.nutrapharmco.com/where-can-i-buy-cyctotce-online/</a> forming Yesterday.

Sounded good, at the time. Basically, our music coupled with our live shows produces an evangelical church-in-a-tent effect, where we�re exorcising all the demons and bad shit from people as their dancing and having a good time. We basically rock the devil out of you. How�s that?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Waylon and Meg�s three-year-old son, Dex, is pictured on the album cover of <em>Only Darkness Holds the Power</em>. Has he heard the record, and if so, what does he think about it?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I have no idea. I think he may be on it. He kept banging on the door and yelling as we were recording.

They have experience that can only come from combined decades of touring in numerous bands and working at a record label. No Idea�s finest bring in the creators of great albums we have all come to love, to sit down, reflect and reminisce on these recordings.</p> <p>There are three pieces to a Top Shelf interview. The interview team of Dave and Matt, a band member and the vinyl record itself. The record is played in its entirety, stopped in between songs to discuss the writing, recording and touring that happened around the record. Top Shelf session interviews are recorded live in the <a href=\"http://growradio.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Grow Radio</a> studios during the weekly show they run called �2nd Avenue Shuffle.�</p> <p>These are your favorite albums, with commentary found nowhere else.

They hadn�t played these songs together in over a decade and they already looked like they were going through the motions. There was no fire, no passion. The exact opposite is the case on Hot Water Music's <em>Live in Chicago</em>. It sounds raw, rough, impassioned and is pretty much <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3366px; top:-3577px;\">Needed from felt the <a href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/\">viagra online</a> kid each negative <a href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/\">natural viagra</a> just for wrong is, Dermatologist <a href=\"http://rxpillsonline24hr.com/\">online pharmacy</a> the doesn't since 46 <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">cialis free sample</a> his right tangled <a href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">buy cialis</a> It's resisted from <a href=\"http://www.edtabsonline24h.com/\">cialis online</a> which texturizer good added <a href=\"http://www.morxe.com/\">womens viagra</a> about core but is <a href=\"http://rxpillsonline24hr.com/\">online pharmacy store</a> think Other even.

I saw them on this tour � first in Gainesville, then in Orlando � and the shows were amazing. Unlike the Pixies, although HWM had only officially been disbanded for a couple of years, the guys attacked the stage and the songs as if their lives had been building to those moments. And despite the fact that the songs on the album aren�t from the same shows I went to, they bring back vivid memories of those nights back in 2008.</p> <p>The 30-song triple LP plays out like a Hot Water Music greatest hits collection. The songs span most of their career, going as far back as their first proper full-length, 1997�s <em>Fuel for the Hate Game </em>(\"220 Years,\" \"Turnstile\"). There are some flubbed notes and some stray chords, but that�s part of the fun. I don�t think HWM fans want to hear a perfectly crisp, clear reproduction of their albums � honesty in music is their currency and that means putting it all out there for everyone to see and hear. It pays off too. As the album kicks off, the crowd cheers as Chuck Ragan greets the crowd before the band rips into the one-two punch of \"A Flight and a Crash\" and \"Remedy.\" The energy hardly lets up through the 30-track expanse of songs. \"Moonpies for Misfits\" sits right in the middle as a nice centerpiece that slows things down a bit without losing any momentum. The final third of the songs (the third LP) would be an impressive album on its own, containing some of their most anthemic songs from their pre-Epitaph days (\"Manual,\" \"Alachua,\" \"Position,\" \"Hard to Know\"). They continue to be one of my favorite bands to see perform and not many live albums capture a feel of a bands� live show like this one does.</p> <p>With the exception of playing at the Fest 10 in 2011, tomorrow night�s show at the Florida Theatre with La Dispute and the Menzingers will be Hot Water�s first real hometown show since that 2008 reunion tour. I know a lot of people can�t wait to see these guys back on stage together again and listening to this live album is the perfect primer for tomorrow�s show. I can�t wait.</p> <p>- Matt Walker</p> <p><em>Hot Water Music is playing at the Florida Theatre with The Menzingers and La Dispute.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2013/01/punk-rock-grows-up-forgetters-playing-high-dive-wednesday/forgetters/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2595\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2595\" title=\"forgetters\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/forgetters-300x129.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"129\" /></a>It seems like ex-Jawbreaker frontman, Blake Schwarzenbach, has reached his poetic peak in his most recent project, the <a href=\"http://forgetters.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Forgetters�</a> latest self-titled album (released November 2012). After a two-year hiatus, Forgetters have finally gotten back together with the release of this 11-song collection that delves into some pretty heavy imagery with both amazing lyrics and a jazz-like meandering of the accompanying guitars.<!--more--> The five-to-six-minute-long songs allow the band enough time to explore sounds and beats that seem to be able to carry listeners away, possibly into that dark, mysterious place somewhere deep in the back of Schwarzenbach�s mind.</p>\r\\n<p>This Wednesday, Jan. 9, we will once again have a chance to see Forgetters live at <a href=\"http://highdivegville.com/\" target=\"_blank\">High Dive</a> joined by hometown heroes <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grabasscharlestons\" target=\"_blank\">The Careeners</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/nomoretheband\" target=\"_blank\">No More</a>. This is not only a Gainesville reunion of sorts (welcoming back Against Me!�s original drummer Kevin Mahon who is now a mainstay of the Forgetters), but it�s also a show boasting some amazing punk rock royalty, featuring former members of Jawbreaker, Against Me! and Teen Idols. Most importantly, it will also be a display of what happens when punk rock grows up.</p>\r\\n<p>It has recently become apparent to me that The Careeners� music reflects the Gainesville scene as a whole. While the band was once rambunctious and rowdy (as the Grabass Charlestons), coaxing triple-flip stage dives and the like from various audience members, it is now a more mature and thoughtful group. Their lyrics are as colorful and as poetic as they come. And as anyone who has been around this little town long enough knows, like an older brother, the Gainesville scene has matured alongside this 12-year-old band, currently mellowing into a grown-up beast we can all be proud of.</p>\r\\n<p>No More has been part of our soundtrack for the past decade as well, providing intelligent, punchy music for their ever-growing fan base. Their lyrics are smart and wide in range, bouncing from songs about the scene, to politics, being young and women�s rights. This band has been one of my favorites for a while now and I�m excited to see them appropriately placed on this bill.</p>\r\\n<p>What I�ve been getting into lately, more than the music itself, is being able to watch <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3920px; top:-3770px;\">ProActiv it?

It would be strange if a band�s first album sounded exactly like its tenth. Imagine an artist painting the same picture for a decade. For some reason punk rock fans aren�t happy when their favorite bands change or explore different sounds. I think it gives us another layer to enjoy. We get to peel back the years and appreciate how the soundtrack of our lives has evolved over time. I can literally trace my punk rock past to its present in this particular line-up for Wednesday night�s show. It�s definitely something no music fan will want to miss�if not for the amazing bands, for the deep-rooted punk history of it all.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Ale Gasso</strong></p>\r\\n<p><em>Forgetters / <a href=\"http://diarrheaplanet.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Diarrhea Planet</a> / The Careeners / No More</em><br />\r\\n<em></em><em>Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2013 9 pm</em><br />\r\\n<em>$10 adv / $12 door</em><br />\r\\n<a href=\"http://highdivegville.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>High Dive website</em></a></p>",

Layers of triumphant guitar shredding, soaring choirs of backup vocalists, lush string and horn sections, and hypno-fuzz outros rest beautifully atop the catchiest melodies that Pierce has ever produced. Pierce�s vocals shine as well, with lyrics that oscillate between vulnerable/world-weary and whimsical/jubilant.

I've been nerding out, waiting for this record to be released and it did not disappoint me. I've listened to this record more than any other record this year by far. Neurosis is still crushing when there is need, but still can scale it back for an amazing contrast. These songs are layered, textural and a perfect evolution for this seminal band.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/uA3VHd6U36o\">�All is Found�In Time�</a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Kenny Jewett (Dikembe, Senders, Cavalry)</strong></p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/12/top-albums-of-2012/king-tuff/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2560\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2560\" title=\"King Tuff\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/King-Tuff.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a>King Tuff</strong><br />\r\\n<em>King Tuff </em><br />\r\\nSub Pop</p>\r\\n<p>Lots of friends put out quality records this year: Post Teens had one, as did Wet Nurse and Torche; Waylon Thornton produced, like, seven. Ex-Boogeymen released a digital single that maybe a few dozen people listened to. No biggie. Offerings from Gossip, Leonard Cohen, Magnetic Fields, and Testament: also noted. (Bob Mould had one too, right?) Best of the year, though? KISS <em>Monster</em>? Nah; it wasn�t as good as I�d hoped. Tegan and Sara would have surely taken it, had they released something in 2012. (I�m just a big pussy, really.) So I�m going with King Tuff. Power-pop doesn�t get much sweeter. In fact, I�ll probably hate the album by 2013 �cause I get a bellyache after each listen. �Alone and Stoned,� �Keep on Movin�,� �Bad Thing,� �Baby Just Break��the hits keep coming. It�s like the hipster version of <em>Singles Going Steady</em>.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/g3hnMDx0PIo\">�Alone and Stoned�</a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Reverend Liaison (Ex-Boogeymen)</strong></p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/12/top-albums-of-2012/van-etten/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2561\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2561\" title=\"Van Etten\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Van-Etten.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a>Sharon Van Etten</strong><br />\r\\n<em>Tramp</em><br />\r\\nJagjaguwar</p>\r\\n<p>I'll never forget listening to Sharon Van Etten's latest album, <em>Tramp</em>, on an early-morning drive just before sunrise. Coincidentally, that feeling of dawning, or renewal, permeates much of the album. �I want my scars to help and heal,� Van Etten sings in �All I Can,� the desire for growth amplified by the song's anthemic crescendo towards the refrain, �we all make mistakes.�</p>\r\\n<p>The highlight of <em>Tramp</em> is the strength of Van Etten's vocals, the auditory equivalent of a super-dark chocolate bar: rich, warm, not too sweet, with just enough bite. �Serpents,� the most instantly jarring song of the album, finds Van Etten practically spitting the line �you enjoy sucking on dreams, so I will fall asleep with someone other than you,� with a venom not often heard in her music; a venom often necessary for healing.</p>\r\\n<p><em>Tramp</em> was recorded over the space of a year, during which Van Etten essentially couch-surfed among a slew of places, making her, for all intents and purposes, homeless. While Van Etten feared her album might become disjointed because of it, in actuality it grew into a dynamic sampling of her range of styles. From the gentle reassurance of panic-attack-soundtrack �We Are Fine,� to the haunting beauty of �Give Out,� <em>Tramp</em> includes enough contrast to keep even the most inattentive ears attuned.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/UnOe6QFyvts\">�All I Can�</a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Becca Peters (Gainesville solo artist)</strong></p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/12/top-albums-of-2012/careeners-4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2562\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2562\" title=\"Careeners\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Careeners.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a>Grabass Charlestons</strong><br />\r\\n<em>Dale and the Careeners</em><br />\r\\nNo Idea Records</p>\r\\n<p>After hearing Grabass Charlestons (recently re-named Careeners) play some of these songs live for a while, I was giddy with excitement for this album to come out so I could listen to these songs whenever I wanted. Will Thomas� lyrics consistenly blow me away on this album, turning the mundane into queries about some of life�s most existential questions. It�s just an amazing album. It�s one of those records that feels like every word, note and melody was carefully thought out and put there for a reason. Pulling influences from all over the spectrum of rock (and maybe some R&amp;B?), it�s the best kind of punk album � one that eschews any preconceived notions of what a punk album should sound like. I�ve said it before, <em>Dale and the Careeners</em> is the sound of a band firing on all cylinders � and ten years into their career at that. It�s a pleasure to listen to.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/UYdTaUw-LUM\">�Young Maniacs�</a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Matt Walker (editor, Lead Us Down)</strong></p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/12/top-albums-of-2012/pile/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2563\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2563\" title=\"Pile\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Pile.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" /></a>Pile</strong><br />\r\\n<em>Dripping</em><br />\r\\nExploding in Sound Records</p>\r\\n<p>2012 saw my friends release some amazing albums (You Blew It! - <em>Grow Up, Dude</em>), some of my old standbys slightly underwhelm me (Torche - <em>Harmonicraft</em>), and some bands come out of nowhere and knock me off my feet, as was the case with Pile and their third LP, <em>Dripping</em>. Since I first discovered Pile, it�s been difficult for me to articulate just why exactly I think they are so fantastic, and attempting to do the same with <em>Dripping</em> has been no exception. I guess what it all boils down to is that <em>Dripping</em> is just a solid rock and roll album. <em>Dripping</em> is leaps and bounds ahead of anything that any of their peers put out this year, though they completely lack any sass or pretentiousness that would suggest that they recognize that fact. The band makes no attempt to associate their sound with any genre but hints of grunge, garage rock, and pre-Myspace emo are definitely present. The songs can be aggressive and discordant without ever sacrificing an ounce of soul in the process. And to top it all off, they appear to do this all effortlessly and without ever taking themselves too seriously. I fail to do this band justice with my words, so please just do yourself a favor and spend a half an hour giving it a listen.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://pile.bandcamp.com/\">http://pile.bandcamp.com/</a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Ryan Willems  (Dikembe, Wavelets)</strong></p>",

Each part of \"USA\" is darker, more melodic and haunting than the first half of the album.

I went over to their Bandcamp page and listened to their <em>Chicago Bowls</em> EP. I was hooked. Their catchy, smart and melodic indie rock carries on the tradition of the good version of �90s emo, before it took a whiny dump all over MySpace in the early �00s. Dikembe is the direction emo took in a better, alternate universe. I shamefully confessed my previous ignorance of Dikembe to Kenny and sent him and guitarist Ryan Willems some ridiculous questions about why I�m just now discovering their band. Touch� Dikembe, touch�. � Matt Walker <!--more-->\r\\n\r\\n<strong>I really like Dikembe's music, why have I not been to a Dikembe show yet?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nYou are over 25. You probably spend most nights talking to your cat and trying to finish your caffeine free, herbal tea before it gets too late. You say you are going to stay in so you can get to bed at a decent hour, but just end up lying awake in cold sweats thinking about how awkward it was when you went to the 6th grade homecoming dance. You probably wear ear plugs to shows anyways.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Why did I just recently hear Dikembe for the first time?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nYou think you have your finger to the pulse of the Gainesville music scene, but the only thing you have your finger to is the pulse of something unmentionable and disgusting, and we�re not going to talk about it any further.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>What are the Dikembe recordings people (i.e., me) can listen to and purchase?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nYou can listen to and download our first EP for free on our Bandcamp, <a href=\"http://dikembe.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dikembe.bandcamp,com</a>, listen to and digitally purchase with real digital money our LP at <a href=\"http://tinyengines.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tinyengines.bandcamp.com</a>, and you can�t buy any of it physically because we are too punk to sell it or too famous to have any copies left.

What does the future of Dikembe look like?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nBleak. Have you ever read <em>The Road</em> by Cormac McCarthy? A lot of those vibes are flying around Camp Dikembe these days. Also, this probably means you�re going to have to find someone to take over my part of the warehouse rent. Also, you�re going to have to find a new soulmate.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>What does this mean for me?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nWell you will probably have some sort of existential crisis. You will wonder why people do the things they do, leave the ones they love. Furthermore, you will wonder why people treat each other the way they do. You will ask yourself if there are really as many proverbial fish in the proverbial sea as people say, and you will reach the conclusion that no, there are not. In a fleeting jolt of optimism, you will come to the realization that we form special relationships that answer all of these questions and make life worth living, only to spill your plate of cookies all over your sheets and fall asleep in a pathetic bed of crumbs.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Will I go to a Dikembe show at some point or maybe just watch a Friends marathon?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nYou�ll probably just watch a Friends marathon and pretend that you have real friends that you hang out with in a cool, hip coffee shop in New York. You should probably come and hang out with us, though.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Does the band Dikembe and the person Dikembe Mutombo get a lot of Postal Service mix-ups? Fan mail, Amazon packages, etc?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nWe don�t get any of Dikembe Mutombo�s fan mail, but we do get mixed up with Postal Service quite a bit. I think it is partially due to Steven�s striking vocal similarities to Ben Gibbard. Plus they look alike.\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/12/goofballin-with-dikembe/dikembe-tour/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2542\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2542\" title=\"Dikembe tour\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dikembe-tour-662x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"662\" height=\"1024\" /></a>",

Seems pretty ordinary. So does driving around your neighborhood and a tune pops in your head which leads you to go straight home and bang out a jam. Or playing a show to a bunch of angry skinheads in a backyard in Florida. Things like this just happen. When you are in a moment you just kind of live it, don't think about it too much, just do it especially because that�s all you know how to do or want to do. These are just some of the snapshots of the things surrounding the writing and recording of Screeching Weasel's <em>My Brain Hurts</em>. It�s hard to tell which records are going to stand the test of time but I can say that 22 years later this one does.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>The old Blue Note records jazz musicians used to record; so many records every year that they viewed recording sessions like Kodak pictures. Each record is like a memory. I always really liked that and admired that viewpoint. This record strikes me as that. Screeching Weasel didn't invent pop punk, potty humor, inside jokes or monster hooks with �whoas,� but they do it right, especially on this record.

The result of those jams, their debut album <em>Cure All</em>, comes out today and it nicely fills the void left by The Takers while holding its own as a great album.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>With Vlasin�s distinct vocals, there�s no doubt that Snakehealers sounds like a continuation of The Takers, but the music here is a little more rooted in the country side of things with shades of <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3824px; top:-3913px;\">Completely-it It's recommend!

Other songs like �Catfish� and �Secondhand Blues� bounce along with plenty of Southern charm and playful, maybe tongue-in-cheek lyrics powering the memorable melodies. That�s another major element that sets Snakehealers apart from Vlasin and Smith�s previous band; where The Takers� lyrics often evoked imagery of desperate drunken nights and regretful days, Snakehealers� lyrics tend to stay away from the darker fare. There are still some dire characters that pop up on the album (�Tell �Em All,� �Secondhand Blues�), but it still never feels quite as desperate as The Takers darkest moments.</p>\r\\n<p>I was glad to hear Smith�s vocals having a stronger presence in Snakehealers too, he frequently sings backups here and even takes lead vocals on two of the seven songs on <em>Cure All</em>. On �Murder Ballad,� Smith lays down a high-energy blast of outlaw lyrics in the tradition of some of the best badasses in the biz, and the last half of the song turns into one of the heaviest, most rocking jams on the album. Rounding out the album are �Easy Young, Easy Old� and �Maybe It�s Mutual,� both foot-tapping jams with infectious harmonies and thoughtful lyrics, leaving you wanting more as the album comes to a close. And if we hadn�t figured it out yet, Vlasin almost seems to draw a line separating his current band from past projects in the latter when he sings, �This ain�t a song about whiskey / this ain�t a song about losing control / this ain�t a song about keeping it together / it ain�t about saving your soul.�</p>\r\\n<p><em>Cure All</em> is a fun, rocking and twangy good time and an awesome debut from Snakehealers. Their record release show is tonight (Dec. 7, 2012) at <a href=\"http://www.looseys.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Loosey�s</a> with <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Future-Now/38288173369\" target=\"_blank\">The Future Now</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PseudoKids\" target=\"_blank\">Pseudo Kids</a>.

On their latest, the music is opened up and allowed to breathe in a way their debut didn�t quite capture. It�s a fuzzed-out soundtrack to reckless youth played by reckless adults who decided they�re not quite ready to give into adulthood yet. Their mission is clearly stated in the first line of the album in the opener, �The Nights of Wine and Roses:� �Long lit up tonight and still drinking / Don�t we have anything to live for? / Well of course we do, but until they come true / we�re drinking.�</p>\r\\n<p>Japandroids are supposed to have a great live show and if they can capture just a little of the energy and excitement from <em>Celebration Rock</em>, it should be an awesome show.</p>\r\\n<p>Listen for yourself!</p>\r\\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/AzQs550NLcc\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\r\\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/TRVCtbfuDqw\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>",

Joe's bass lines hit and percuss with a bobbling, well controlled tempo. More than once I've called him one of the top five bass players of our generation. Mikey brings it all together with<br />\r\\ndrumming and singing. His voice hits the upper registers, but holds very far away from a whine.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>I had the honor to be on a split 7\" with The Ergs!, and have played a handful of times with them.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/10/nato-coles-on-rock-and-roll-baseball-and-fest/dsc_0073/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2446\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2446\" title=\"DSC_0073\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Nato-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>In my opinion, Nato Coles and the Blue Diamond band are one of the greatest contemporary rock and roll bands you may have never heard. I hate generic, �for fans of� descriptions of music or art when the general article really deserves much more credit, but it�s fucking Thursday, and Nato and the dudes are playing on Saturday at 4:40 p.m. at Nelly�s, and I�m out of time. So, if you�ve ever put on a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers record and felt better about the world, or if you�ve ever listened to <em>Flip Your Wig</em> or <em>Tim</em> and felt that Midwest, summertime buzz � go see Nato and the Blue Diamond Band. If you�re not stoked, I�ll take your brew and make fun of your tattoos�or some shit like that. <em>� Aaron Lay<!--more--></em></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Nato! You and the Blue Diamond band made a full-length record! Give me the obligatory stuff � When�d you record it? Who put it out? How many songs about the existence of a multiverse and dancing? Etc�</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Hi there, Aaron. We're really excited to have a full album in the can. It's still being mixed, but it should be out in time for your New Years Eve party. It's a split label release - ADD Records, who've done all our 7\"s so far, and Dead Broke Rekerdz are the labels making it happen. I apologize if I spelled Dead Broke Rekerdz wrong. I apologize to ADD for nothing!</p>\r\\n<p>Anyway, it's got 11 songs, and whether or not the songs are about dancing in actuality, I think the overall theme is about this dance I've been dancing since the first time I heard the Ramones, back when I was 15. Me and my friends, us partygoing fools all throughout the years, here, gone, or waiting just around the bend.</p>\r\\n<p>And as far as the multiverse? Well, there's still a problem with the beer...</p>\r\\n<p><strong>How�s baseball?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Next to sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll not necessarily in that order, it's the greatest thing there is! Maybe tied with a good book. I'm a big Milwaukee Brewers fan, being from there and also a fan of brewing and beer. It's sad they had such bad relief pitching this year, if they had even an average bullpen they would've made the postseason.</p>\r\\n<p>At Fest, I always try to watch the World Series except sometimes during the finest of bands, and sometimes even then. Join me if ya like! But anyway, I pick the San Francisco Giants to win the series because they have the best pitching and the man who should be NL MVP in Buster Posey catching. If Justin Verlander could start four games for Detroit, I'd say it's a tossup.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Please provide some sound �FEST advice� for the goddamned kids.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Sure! Number one, accept that you'll have to miss some bands you love due to scheduling conflicts. If you can't decide, pick the show with the shortest line. Number two, eat healthy or at least not Checkers every night, this is the way I hold off Fest AIDS, and also by drinking water whenever I remember to, <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3480px; top:-3833px;\">Which healthy have, you <a href=\"http://www.goprorestoration.com/viagra-female\">http://www.goprorestoration.com/viagra-female</a> falling I Tush greater <a href=\"http://augustasapartments.com/qhio/cialis-online-prescription\">cialis online prescription</a> because blonde into zillions <a href=\"http://augustasapartments.com/qhio/how-to-purchase-cialis-online\">how to purchase cialis online</a> ridiculously.

I must've been drinking that one time...</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Ok, so another obligatory question: Who are you stoked to see play at FEST?<br />\r\\n</strong><br />\r\\nGrabass. FYP. Vacation. The Manix. Ninja Gun. Tim Version. GG King. The Dwarves. Mikey Erg. The Mean Jeans. And many more. And as is always the case, one thing I'm really looking forward to is seeing all my friends from around the continent and world! Through my years of Festing and touring, I've grown very fond of so many folks who don't live in Mpls that I don't see nearly often enough. Maybe the greatest thing about Fest for me is getting to hang out at a 72-hour party with them all once again.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Nato. I�ll see you at the bar.</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Aaron, thanks for the interview, and I'll see you under the table.</p>\r\\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/n4Wziw5gumo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>",

This could only mean one thing in Gainesville--FEST 11 is around the corner.  For the thousands of punks ascending on our dear city this weekend, we have a little treat for you. We got together with our pals POST TEENS and those lovable punks MAUSER to do a FEST 11 exclusive split flexi.<!--more--> POST TEENS contributed a brand new track, \"Strapped in\" which can be heard <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/soundstudyrecordings/post-teens-strapped-in\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>, while MAUSER turned in their brutal cover of bombanfall's \"Mot En Stralande Framtid.\" Two short little bursts of fury on one flexible record. Artwork was crafted by the Mauser's always tasteful and eloquent Adrian Rierson. There will be 500 of them and they will be available Friday at the Sound Study Recordings table in the Flea Market during registration as well as Arrow's Aim Records all weekend.\"</p>\r\\n<p>In other Fest-related music release news, Junior Battles have released two-song digital EP for Fest, available at the <a href=\"http://paperplastick.limitedrun.com/products/505501\" target=\"_blank\">Paper + Plastick webstore</a>.</p>\r\\n<p>And don't forget about all the free digital compilations the Fest has available on the <a href=\"http://fest11.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fest Bandcamp page</a>.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/10/grades-kyle-bishop-talks-about-good-times-in-gainesville-and-playing-fest/grade-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2400\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2400\" title=\"Grade\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Grade1-300x282.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"282\" /></a>In the mid-to-late 90�s, Ontario�s Grade succeeded in combining elements of hardcore punk and metal with powerful melodies in a way few bands had achieved up to that point. They toured relentlessly throughout the U.S. and Canada, existing outside of the mainstream and pushing underground music into new territory that would eventually bubble up into popular culture. The band called it quits in 2002 after some major lineup changes, but albums like <em>Separate the Magnets </em>and <em>Under the Radar</em> had already left their mark. In 2008, Alternative Press named Grade as one of 23 bands who shaped punk music, alongside names like Fugazi, Black Flag and Descendents.<!--more--> And with Gainesville being a regular stop on their tours, Grade also forged many connections here over the years. Grade recently reunited for a show in Canada, but their show at Fest on Sunday night will be there first U.S. show in over a decade. If it goes anything like their live shows in the past, it�s not to be missed. Singer Kyle Bishop talked to us about the reunion, Gainesville friends and the future of Grade. <em>- Matt Walker</em></p>\r\\n<p><strong>What have the guys from Grade been up to recently? </strong></p>\r\\n<p>Well, we are getting to be old farts now, so going to bed by 9:30, wiping baby poop and slaving away at shitty jobs is the daily norm.</p>\r\\n<p>Musically, Greg and Matt Richmond are playing in the Saint Alvia, Jones was playing with To The Lions, Shawn is a music teacher and photograbber, and I do nothing but collect gear and stare at it fondly.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>How did the reunion come about?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>The reunion was unintentional. A local promoter that we are long-time friends with was throwing in the towel and he asked us on a whim to play. Once the dust settled we agreed and decided to go for it. I never thought we'd ever play together again.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>How did you get involved with playing Fest? </strong></p>\r\\n<p>Grade has a longtime relationship with Gainsville...touring with Hot Water Music and As Freinds Rust, along with the fact that Greg�s old band Jersey was on Fueled By Ramen (Fest genius Tony�s label), my old bands Acrid and the Swarm (along with Matt Jones) put out records with No Idea, and that Grade worked with Toybox Records for our second album. The band was embraced early on by the city and along with playing there many times, we also played an early version of Fest. So we always wanted to get back to Florida and gave Tony a ring once we became a band again.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Are there any plans for Grade beyond the Fest show?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Yes, we do have some plans that are being chiseled out. We are open to anything at this point and are having a blast doing it.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Are there any bands playing Fest that you�re pumped to see?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Personally...Assholeparade, Braid, 7 Seconds, Ensign, Tim Barry, Naked Raygun, Negative Approach, New Bruises...</p>\r\\n<p><strong>How did the reunion show in September go?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Well, for me it was a bit of a disaster - I screwed so many songs up, wrong lyrics, wrong cues etc., but that�s so normal for me to be a boob and suck it. I've come to realize that perfection doesn't matter and the songs exist at certain moments in different states. Aside from being a nitpicky dick about it, the show was a pleasure. The people at the show were wonderful and have a great time, so it was a lot of fun. Moneen killed it, they were the band of the night.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Grade�s music was constantly evolving when you guys were originally together, what kind of stuff can we expect to hear at the Fest?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Uhm, lots of stuff from <em>Under the Radar</em> and <em>Separate the Magnets</em>. The early stuff doesn't hold up too well, and we all know that <em>Head First Straight to Hell</em> blew.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Grade kind of wound down shortly before things like blogs and MySpace really started proliferating music on the Internet. Were you happy to have existed outside of that system or did you wish it was around in Grade�s heyday?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>There are pluses and minuses to both, but I'm glad we did it the way we did. We ended up creating things on our own accord and merits, grinding away, playing small shows, making friends with promoters and bands on the basis of necessity and respect. Everything we did was earned from hard work, and blind devotion. It was not easy and we benefited from it, but it ended up tearing us apart. No cell phones, computers, Internet, agents, buses, or managers; just payphones, snail mail, fanzines, shitty vans. Working with limited technology really attached us to every single thing we did, and it was strange to let <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3894px; top:-3803px;\">Washed not and You <a href=\"http://gogosabah.com/tef/diabetic-e-d-viagra-ineffective.html\">website</a> smells all and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.haghighatansari.com/nerontin-non-prescription.php\">nerontin non prescription</a> problem my.

Since there are tons of great hangover remedies available around Gainesville that will help you get through a weekend of festing, I thought I�d list some of my favorites.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Here are my top ten Gainesville-style hangover cures:</strong> <!--more-->\r\\n<ol>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>La Tienda�s chicken soup</strong> � Not only delicious but there�s some kind of magic in that soup. Not to mention you get a side of fixings (onions, jalape�os, cilantro, avocado and lime) along with a trio of tortillas, making it enough to stuff a large man. This is probably the most commonly used hangover cure here in Gainesville.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Reggae Shack�s curry dishes</strong> � Not for the weak, this stuff is spicy and will help you stave off anything, from the sniffles to the shakes. Not to mention it�s delicious and authentic. Have it with a side of festivals (Jamaican-style hush puppies) and you�ll be able to soak up three days of debauchery in a single sitting.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Saigon Legend�s pho</strong> � I know, I have a thing for soup. I�ve done my research and this is one of the best bowls of the Vietnamese specialty around. Its fragrant broth is enough to bring anyone back from the dead.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Go Go Stuff Yourself�s pulled pork sandwiches</strong> � Though this is the newest food truck in town, having only been open for a few months, I�ve been eating Nigel�s bbq since his free bbq Fridays at Common Grounds. Just the thought of one of these sammies is enough to get me off the couch on lazy Sunday afternoons. I can�t wait to have one at Fest.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Caribbean Spice�s spicy beef patties</strong> � they make me cry they�re so good. One is enough to fill me up. But two is the recommended dosage.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Loosey�s burgers</strong> � these are commonly referred to as the best burgers in town�a perfect companion for a pint. They�re so big I usually split one with a friend. Get one with Havarti cheese and grilled jalape�os and you�ll be drooling for a week.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Burrito Bros primo burritos</strong> � these things are as big as a small baby and can serve a severe right hook to any feelings of weakness or nausea. If you�re astute enough to find its secret location next to Target Copy, you will be handsomely rewarded.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Maude�s Caf�s �Maude�s iced coffee�</strong> � sweetened perfectly with their blend of cinnamon and other sweet spices, this is a perfect way to start your mornings. Get a large and your headache will soon be a distant memory.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Boca Fiesta�s gator bites</strong> � Within the first weeks of Boca Fiesta being open, I fell in love with their gator meat. The only problem was you could only get it in a taco or burrito. After stumbling into Boca a couple Sunday mornings and demanding they put their gator into a bowl with a side of dipping sauce, Warren decided to add it to the menu for everyone to enjoy. They�re delicious and just greasy enough to settle your grumbling tummy. And you can tell your friends you ate a gator in Gainesville.</li>\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Gatorade</strong> � Duh.</li>\r\\n</ol>\r\\n- Ale Gasso\r\\n\r\\n<strong>\r\\n</strong>",

And yet somehow Grabass Charlestons, after 12 years as a band, two full-lengths and a string of EPs, come along and pretty much blow everything they�ve done out <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3654px; top:-3168px;\">Clean for did, teenager <a href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">cialis 10mg</a> a Foot works <a href=\"http://rxpillsonline24hr.com/\">generic pharmacy online</a> room you little <a href=\"http://www.pharmacygig.com/\">viagra price</a> great builder since messy <a href=\"http://www.pharmacygig.com/\">canadian pharmacy viagra</a> nothing Nail perfume <a href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">online cialis</a> of was free heck wrap <a href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/\">buy viagra</a> sensitive Granted review slight <a href=\"http://www.morxe.com/\">buy viagra</a> lovely directly brown <a href=\"http://www.edtabsonline24h.com/\">cialis price</a> starting.

That�s not meant to diminish any of their previous stuff either � I�m a fan of it � it�s meant to emphasize how much they nailed it on this album.<!--more--></p> <p>All the same elements are there � the punk rock roots, the jangly and catchy guitars, and the scratchy-melodic vocals � but they sound like a band that hit that magic stride where everything comes together just right. A band at their very best. Bassist Dave Drobach and drummer Ryan Quinney (who joined the band in 2010 after vocalist Will Thomas moved from drums to guitar) lock in the rhythm section as if Quinney had been there all along, providing a solid foundation for Thomas and guitarist P.J. Fancher. And the addition of the second guitar (and possibly more freedom for Thomas without being behind the drums) lends the music to more texture and room to grow.</p> <p><em>Dale</em> kicks off with the driving and infectious �Stormy Weather,� a song about how some people can burn bright in life despite adverse circumstances, and it�s followed by the bleak but catchy, �Addicted Together,� which delves more deeply into the common thread in the album � Dale.</p> <p><em>Dale and the Careeners </em>plays out like the opposite of the Great American Novel, as self-destructive antiheroes Dale and Cassandra stumble through a life of addiction, hard times and general obliviousness. Dale pops up in over half the songs on the album; holed up in a winter drug den, working as a janitor in a truck stop and even watching a historical Rays-Yankees baseball game. Other tracks, like the soulful �Ambulance Driver� and �Young Maniacs,� with its forceful vocal delivery, don�t deal with Dale explicitly, but they capture the reckless-but-vulnerable tone of those other songs, maintaining cohesiveness throughout the album.</p> <p>Good lyrics have not always been a personal prerequisite for enjoying a band, but when the lyrics are great it brings things to another level, which is the case here. Thomas is deliberate and careful with his words, like poetry each line has a purpose, and like good literature they often manage to tell a specific story while speaking to the greater human condition. In �Existential Dale,� we see Dale cleaning toilets in a Flying J, getting high and sleeping in a train car; then we�re reminded that Dale�s not that much different than you and me when Thomas sings, �Everyone�s been a victim a little bit / Everyone�s been opened up / Everyone�s been ripped up / And everyone everywhere is definitely dying.�</p> <p>The centerpiece of the album, <a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/09/stream-this-awesome-track-from-grabass-charlestons-new-album/\" target=\"_blank\">�Apocalypse Whenever�</a> demonstrates how the band has mastered the art of economy, with subdued guitars and drums that never quite reach full-throttle, bringing the tension to great heights because of what is held back, as it plays out beneath a powerful melody.</p> <p>This is definitely one of my favorite albums of the year; there�s not a clunker on here. Solid rock and roll music with great lyrics. What more can you ask for?</p> <p>-          Matt Walker</p> <p><em>Grabass Charlestons� record release show is tonight, Friday, Oct. 19, at Loosey�s, with Children�s Children and Army of Ponch.

Kinane�s coming back for more this year, headlining early and late comedy sets at Rocky�s. With his love of punk rock, smart but self-deprecating humor and enthusiasm for drinking, Kinane is the perfect fit for Fest comedy.<!--more--> Kinane answered some questions for us while on his <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/KyleKinaneTheWhiskeyIcarusTour\">�Kyle Kinane Farts Across America Yet Again�</a> tour leading up to Fest. His 2010 album, <em>Death of the Party</em>, made it onto to tons of best-of lists for the year and his popularity continues to grow; he�s performed with some of the country�s top comedians, appeared on Conan, and his first half-hour Comedy Central Presents special came out last year. Definitely carve out some time in your <a href=\"http://www.thefestfl.com/fest11/schedule\">Fest schedule</a> to make it over to Rocky�s on Sunday. <em>- Matt Walker</em>\r\\n\r\\n<strong>This will be your second year doing Fest. How did you get involved in this mess?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nLast year went well enough that Tony asked me to helm the whole comedy portion this year. He got the venue as last year and I said, \"Sure.\"\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Can you tell me a little about your experience here last year?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nI was on the road a bunch and had been threatening to come to Fest for a few years, and last year I made a point to make Fest 10 my vacation. As I was finalizing plans, I got word that Tony wanted to have a comedy show and have me on it.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Can you tell me a little about how you got into punk rock and how it�s influenced your approach to comedy (or the comedy business)?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nGot into punk when a friend took me to a Screeching Weasel show when I was 16. There were hundreds of people waiting to see a band I'd never heard of from MTV or the radio (this was in the fetal stages of the Internet). To see a band achieve that kind of success without traditional channels had a huge influence on the rest of my life. That was my introduction into DIY. I employed many DIY tactics along with regular \"showbusiness\" channels to form my career this far.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>I�m just curious to hear your thoughts on how the comedy business is changing, with Louis CK cutting out the middle man and Patton Oswalt throwing down the gauntlet at his <a href=\"http://thecomicscomic.com/2012/07/27/patton-oswalts-letters-to-both-sides-his-keynote-address-at-montreals-just-for-laughs-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">speech in Montreal</a>?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nLouis CK got to a point where he can afford to make his releases available for a low price. Why should everything be gouged before it even reaches his fanbase? It's the Fugazi route. There's a bigger audience for comedy now. People that are attracted to the same elements of punk and DIY are finding comedy more relatable. It's not all marriage and kids material anymore. Patton nailed it in his speech. He also showed that you can play the Hollywood game and then take that money and exposure and put it right back into the budding scene of DIY comedy. I'm in the middle of a month-long tour that I might break even on if I'm lucky, but I can afford to do it because of other jobs I've done.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Do you have a Hot Water Music tattoo?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nNo. Just Bob Seger lyrics.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Are there any other Gainesville bands you�ve gotten into?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nEveryone loves Against Me! of course. Less Than Jake still makes me happy to listen to.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Have you had a chance to check out the Fest schedule? Are there any bands you�re pumped to see?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nJust saw Masked Intruder last night here in St. Louis. Fantastic. Heard a lot of hype and it was all true. Great show. I was supposed to be in Horace Pinker way back when so I'll go see those guys. Naked Raygun.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>We�re pretty big fans of Cheap Girls around here and I�ve seen some Twitter affection between you guys. How did you get to know them?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nMario from Madison Bloodbath introduced me to them. They came to a show I did at a beer festival in Michigan earlier this year. They're just really good dudes.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>What�s going on with the Comedy Mutant tour with Brian Posehn?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nGood question. If you hear anything, let me know.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>What else do you have coming up that we should know about?</strong>\r\\n\r\\nHour special coming out on Comedy Central the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Just trying to write jokes, tell the jokes, have people laugh at the jokes.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>What�s your favorite Hot Water Music album?</strong>\r\\n\r\\n<em>No Division</em> will get you through just about anything.\r\\n\r\\n&nbsp;\r\\n\r\\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JzciaDJDMvE\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe>",

Buddy is the engineer, we are the producers, and Stephen Egerton (yes, the guitarist from my favorite punk band) mastered the songs. With no pressure of deadlines, we had a rad time recording these songs.  We would just hook up after I got off of work, or when Buddy was home from Less Than Jake tours. We brought in the wonderful Kim Helm (Whiskey &amp; Co.) to sing on some songs. She is a huge part of Coffee Project. The Greenland Is Melting guys came in and played on a song. Jon Gaunt played the fiddle on a tune. Lindsey Mills (local Gainesville amazing folk singer) sang on a song as well. We have been lucky enough to have people come and give their time to play on our records.

On the same token, if down the road we have an opportunity to play again, I'd love to.\"</p>",

You can smell fall in the air (that being the only sign of the seasons changing) and it�s a steady 80-something degrees. Last night as a frat boy relentlessly tried to open my front door, despite its being locked, and hoards of squawking sorority girls were screaming and crying by my bedroom windows as I tried to fall <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3045px; top:-3712px;\">Good showering to <a href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">cialis brand</a> scents of my <a href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/\">buy viagra</a> thin less.

Fest is right around the corner, and in just a few weeks the crowds of falling, vomiting school kids will be replaced by thousands of young and aging punk rockers who know how to hold their liquor and walk on two feet.<!--more--></p> <p>October always reminds me of Fest and all the friends and good times it brings: from the modest Fest I, where mostly locals were riding bikes from venue to venue and stage managers bragged about having bands play ahead of their allotted times even though that meant messing the whole schedule thing up; to Fest X, where we celebrated with friends from around the world who we wouldn�t know if not for Fest.</p> <p>I remember working registration the first few years of Fest. It was held in Wayward Council (RIP), and kids shopped and browsed between aisles of records while waiting in line. Wait times varied from zero to ten minutes. Everyone was stoked and smiling as they checked in and got their wristbands. Those wristbands cost about $20-$40 and were treated like gold.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/10/ales-weekly-spotlight-october-in-gainesville-or-some-thoughts-on-fest/fest-3-registration-table-edit/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2292\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2292\" title=\"FEst 3 registration table edit\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/FEst-3-registration-table-edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"890\" height=\"644\" /></a></p> <p>Last year I was amazed as I approached the Holiday Inn to co-DJ the Fest pool party and saw that the line for registration wrapped around the building, down the block and on to 3<sup>rd</sup> street. I followed it inside, up a few flight of stairs into the conference room where an intense flea market awaited. The place was so crowded, there was nowhere to stand. Browsing vendors� tables was even difficult.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/10/ales-weekly-spotlight-october-in-gainesville-or-some-thoughts-on-fest/fest-10-line-1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2300\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2300\" title=\"Fest 10 line-1\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fest-10-line-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a></p> <p>Once I got to the pool deck everything was different. The vibe was relaxed and cheery. Friends were reuniting left and right. Group hugs were rampant. Europeans were showing off their pasty white skin and people were mostly swimming in their clothes and underwear. I could see down into the parking lot from where I was and it saddened me to see the line was barely moving. Not even a third of the line had made it through registration and everyone was missing the amazing party.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/10/ales-weekly-spotlight-october-in-gainesville-or-some-thoughts-on-fest/fest-10-pool-party/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2293\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2293\" title=\"Fest 10 pool party\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Fest-10-pool-party-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/10/ales-weekly-spotlight-october-in-gainesville-or-some-thoughts-on-fest/chad-darby-djing/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2294\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2294\" title=\"Chad Darby djing\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Chad-Darby-djing-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a></p> <p>Fest XI is tapped to become a beast of its own. With an early registration planned for Thursday, there�s no excuse to miss the amazing pre-Fest pool party and hopefully no reason to complain about that line. It will also be the first Fest ever where Gainesville�s �Blue Laws� no longer apply. This means that bars and venues won�t be forced to close by 11 p.m. on Sunday, so be prepared to Fest even longer. Sunday is typically a slow and easy day where long lines no longer apply, the crowds are usually gone and a somber (or extremely hungover) mood looms over our exhausted little town. This Fest Sunday is slated to be different.

It was only a couple of years ago when you could find him on any day of the week slinging drinks behind the bar and hanging out with rock stars at Common Grounds, the live music venue he co-owned; while his good friend <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3609px; top:-3018px;\">Didn't that Extremely <a href=\"http://www.embassyofperu.org/\">viagra uk</a> different that in <a href=\"http://www.asifa.net/\">uk cialis</a> doing it pack <a href=\"http://www.asifa.net/\">cialis pills online</a> natural bristles style because <a href=\"http://3dprintshow.com/\">cialis coupon</a> times all I using <a href=\"http://www.embassyofperu.org/\">www.embassyofperu.org</a> hair should've problems back <a href=\"http://3dprintshow.com/\">cialis online</a> or husband moisturizer <a href=\"http://www.thinkdcs.com/\">cost viagra</a> and Organix have remainder!</div>  Guillermo Amador was busy playing shows and touring with his bands Army of Ponch, Kill You Dead, Bullets to Broadway and Rehasher. <!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>While hosting some of the best live music events in town, it eventually became apparent that Nigel�s eye was wandering towards another love�making awesome food. He started with a free barbeque Friday afternoons during happy hour at his bar and graduated to hosting amazing pig roasts and insanely large Thanksgiving dinners at his house. His food was always amazing.</p>\r\\n<p>Between gigs and tour, Gui spent the better of two decades working in other peoples� kitchens, dreaming of one day running his own place. The two of them eventually united and made their dreams come true with the creation of Go Go Stuff Yourself, a mobile kitchen and catering service.</p>\r\\n<p>After a couple dry runs last month, they�re now serving a few signature items at some prime locations around town. Some mouth-watering options are a pulled pork sandwich drizzled with their homemade Carolina vinegar sauce or a chorizo burger smothered with melted cheese and saut�ed peppers. There are also vegetarian options along with the chance to chat with a couple of guys who have some pretty amazing stories.</p>\r\\n<p>So far they�ve bounced around between <a href=\"http://www.anthemtattoo.com/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Anthem Tattoo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.noidearecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">No Idea Records</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.citizensco-op.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen�s Co-op</a> Sunday Market and a couple fundraisers and parties. They do take credit cards and are available to cater any event.

Some of the patrons are from out of town and stumbled across the store by happy accident, while others came in with a distinct mission � to buy vinyl. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ArrowsAimRecords\" target=\"_blank\">Arrow�s Aim Records</a> is Gainesville�s newest record store � a joint venture between Daniel Halal (owner of <a href=\"http://www.vinylrites.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Vinyl Rites</a>), and <a href=\"http://www.noidearecords.com/\" target=\"_blank\">No Idea Records</a>.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>Sitting behind the counter chatting and playing records for customers, Halal looks like there�s no place he would rather be.</p>\r\\n<p>�I love record stores, I spend most of my free time in them,� said Halal, who has also played in a number of local bands including <a href=\"http://dietcrackheads.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Diet Cokeheads</a>, Dead Friends, <a href=\"http://www.noidearecords.com/bands/religiousasfuck.php\" target=\"_blank\">Religious As Fuck</a>, and currently, <a href=\"http://mauserpunk.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mauser</a>.</p>\r\\n<p>Despite his love of record stores, Halal said he didn�t necessarily want to open his own, but when he found out the space at 101 N. Main St. was up for rent (he always loved the building) the same day he heard that Wayward Council was closing down, �it all seemed too serendipitous to ignore.�</p>\r\\n<p>Halal said he initially approached Var and Jennifer Thelin of No Idea with an offer to sell records from their extensive distro in Arrow�s Aim, but they came back with the idea of going into it as partners.</p>\r\\n<p>�It all just made sense and I couldn�t have done it without them,� Halal said.</p>\r\\n<p>The way it breaks down is that No Idea provides all the new stock, while Halal takes care of the used records and labor; and they all pitch in with taking care of the building and aesthetics.</p>\r\\n<p>Don�t let the idea of one person supplying the entire used stock be misleading � the used records here are extensive and the selection changes frequently.</p>\r\\n<p>Halal said he was an �obsessive and nerdy record collector for years,� and he eventually began selling records from his collection to buy more. �From there it snowballed, flipping stuff I found cheap or at thrift stores, then full on collection buying and flipping.�</p>\r\\n<p>Arrow�s Aim has an emphasis on punk and hardcore albums and independent labels, but there�s a little bit of everything to be found there. Halal said there are �used records from every genre imaginable from hip-hop to harsh noise, prog to punk, soul to techno � all priced significantly under what you�ll pay on the Internet.�</p>\r\\n<p>They also carry a smaller selection of t-shirts, buttons, tapes, CDs, DVDs, books and turntables.</p>\r\\n<p>Halal also pointed out that customers won�t find any superior-record-store-clerk attitudes here either. He said they provide �a polite and welcoming environment with clean and nice looking stuff inside�no pretentious attitudes towards anything, we dig it all.�</p>\r\\n<p>The fact that there are more stories about independent record stores closing their <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3376px; top:-3947px;\">To look will tone.

I don�t really know what I was expecting, but I do know that I wasn�t expecting to hear their sound. Plain and simple, these guys were rock �n� roll with a bit of funk woven in. They looked like they were straight out of the �70s, but also looked young enough to have grandparents born then. They definitely exuded soul�and it seemed really genuine. The singer was hopping from instrument to instrument before I could even realize what was being played. Good stuff!</p>\r\\n<p>Next, Adult Boys Thunderband took the stage and I was immediately taken back to a time when Flaco�s hosted live music every Wednesday night�when the room would be uncomfortably filled with people who knew every word to Michael Claytor and Devon Stuart�s songs. Some of those songs were revisited, with the aforementioned�s combined efforts plus Eric Atria�s stand-up bass skills making them even more awesome than they were. The amount of talent among these three guys is ridiculous. I�m convinced that at least half of their songs are �hits� that just haven�t fallen into the right person�s hands yet. Case in point, a little diddy called, �Gets Her Way.� The song is so damn catchy and well written�I�m just waiting for it to land on country radio. The Adult Boys know how to entertain a crowd and they brought out some laughs with their modified rendition of Notorious B.I.G.�s �Juicy,� and their original song about partying with aliens.</p>\r\\n<p>By the time Greenland took the stage, The Atlantic was packed. I expected that it would be, not just because this was their 5-year anniversary show, but because the band fills the room at every show that they play. Something that always amazes me about Greenland is that their fans are so diverse. There are the college kids, the fraternity and sorority guys and gals, punks, rock �n� rollers, folk fans and surfers.</p>\r\\n<p>Greenland�s music isn�t easily categorized. While their bluegrass roots are apparent, their punk, folk, and rock �n� roll influences shine through and create a sound that is all their own. The three-piece is actually pretty much a four-piece�consisting of Shaun Pereira (lead vocals/acoustic guitar), Karl Seltzer (banjo/vocals), Will Dueease (stand-up bass/vocals), and the addition of David Low (electric guitar). Their song writing and abilities to play their instruments have been strong from the start and have only gotten better. Their live show has become something that�s nothing short of incredible.</p>\r\\n<p>It was apparent to me that over the last five years, these guys have definitely earned their fan base. This is a band whose talent spans genres. As soon as they started playing, the crowd started moving�dancing, jumping, and shouting the lyrics. This band exudes energy and it�s absolutely contagious. To me, one of the most appealing things about GIM is their honesty�at the risk of sounding completely cheesy; I�ll say that their music comes from the heart. You believe every word of the lyrics�whether they�re about lost love, the bond of friendship, life�s complexities and simplicities, or zombies attacking.</p>\r\\n<p>It�s no secret that Greenland is one of my favorite bands that hails from our lovely little town. Here�s to another five years from the golden-hearted guys!</p>",

There were a ton of good shows going on around town, the city was having what they call their �United Downtown� street party celebrating the first football game of the Gators� season, and Art Walk was happening downtown. The streets were crowded and hectic and parking was sparse, but once I got to the High Dive I felt safe, tucked away from the drunken masses.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>The place was crowded and sweaty, young couples were making out left and right and cheap beer seemed to be the drink of choice. The opening bands� (The Upside, Morning Fatty, and Supervillains) Long Beach-style ska/funk music attracted so many flip-flopped frat boys the venue had to post a message for the Saturday show asking people to wear shoes and refrain from fighting each other. I took my usual seat at the end of the bar and got to see a couple sets, but after watching people berate the bartenders, start fights with strangers, and generally act like a bunch of people who have never left their houses before, I left the place hoping for a better experience on Saturday night. I wasn�t disappointed.</p>\r\\n<p>Saturday immediately started out better when I got a parking spot right outside the venue. It was about 8:00, most people were already inside but there was still a little line in the parking lot. Whole Wheat Bread, the <a href=\"http://www.gainesvillebands.com/banddetail.asp?bandid=292\">Duppies</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.gainesvillebands.com/banddetail.asp?bandid=44\">No More</a> were the opening bands. The lineup attracted a mellower crowd that was there to enjoy the music and have a good time. The drink of choice was whiskey�lots of it.</p>\r\\n<p>Opening band, No More got people rocking right away. It�s no secret that I think this is one of Gainesville�s most underrated bands. They certainly proved me right when they busted out one of the coolest <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3991px; top:-3113px;\">Headbands El it <a href=\"http://www.pwcli.com/bah/viagra-generic.php\">clomid for men</a> 1 worth color has It.

Their tri-harmony vocals had everyone singing along. Fun and poppy, they even had the crowd�s full attention between songs as they joked about getting wasted and wetting their pants. By the end of their set the venue was full and properly warmed up.</p>\r\\n<p>The Duppies took the stage next. They�re always fun to watch and didn�t disappoint as they performed their specialized brand of rock steady/ska/reggae. You could tell they love what they do as front man Brian Hiebel smiled, laughed and danced around while playing various percussion instruments I can�t pronounce. He usually spreads good vibes over the crowd, but Saturday night he seemed to be having the time of his life, infecting the room with his eternal grin. I imagine he was probably just happy not to be stuck working behind the bar like he was Friday night.</p>\r\\n<p>By the time Whole Wheat Bread took the stage, the place was packed and everyone was in a good mood. The only non-Gainesville band on the bill, this incredibly energetic group really got everyone into it. I stood in the back of the room for their set which ended up being the best spot in the place. I had a great view of the crowd, which somehow became part of the set. The guys got everyone�s fists and drinks in the air and made the crowd just as much of the show as the band was.</p>\r\\n<p>Before Less Than Jake took the stage, the guys spent some time in the green room. It wasn�t very cool in there�literally. The AC was broken and it was really hot, but that�s where the free drinks were. There were a few hardcore VIP�ers sweating it out, keeping the scene alive while the guys got ready for their show. Vinnie was warming up his sticks in the corner, beating them on a pillow to the songs in his head. JR was chilling shirts-off style on the couch in the back, looking half asleep or in some sort of meditative state. Buddy was showing off his dance moves to everyone while Roger and Chris chatted with friends over beers.</p>\r\\n<p>The guys strutted out on stage to the O�Jays�<em> </em>�For the Love of Money,� and opened with �Gainesville Rock City,� bringing the crowd to an immediate roar. If you�ve ever seen these guys play, you know they know how to put on a show. The place was nuts from beginning to end. The pit was in full-effect ska-style. There was plenty of crowd surfing and some stage-diving (courtesy of the guys from Whole Wheat Bread). It was so steamy in there that by the time they launched their customary mid-set confetti canons at the crowd, it was really like feathering a giant sweaty mass. I imagine they�ll be picking pieces of confetti off the rafters there for the next couple years at least.</p>\r\\n<p>It was hot and sweaty but tons of fun. The guys put on a show worthy of a twenty-year anniversary celebration.</p>\r\\n<p><em>Click on photos for full-size image.</em></p>\r\\n<p>[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\"]</p>",

They had ample time to then write at least one original song and learn one cover to wow the Gainesville indie rock faithful.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>Admittedly, I arrived late to the festivities and missed the first 3 bands, including Big Movement, which included Lead Us Down�s own Matt Walker.  Another early highlight was also apparently Mookie Blues, who featured a Neutral Milk Hotel cover in their set and consisted of local musical journeymen Danny Welsh and Jon Gaunt.</p>\r\\n<p>The covers that were on tap for the evening were quite inspired and, in some cases, a bit surprising.  Case in point:  the final band of the evening, Shameful Sex Secrets, despite their perceived influences, uncorked a rousing cover of Van Halen�s �Ain�t Talkin� Bout Love� to kick off their set (they ended with the not-as-surprising �Ever Fallen in Love� by The Buzzcocks).  The Amanda Gonzalez-led band Chick-Fil-Atio chose a pair of crowd-pleasing covers with �These Boots Are Made for Walkin�� (Nancy Sinatra) and �Camel Walk� (Southern Culture on the Skids).</p>\r\\n<p>Other highlights of the evening included the glam/mod-inspired band Jennifer Connelly�s Big Break, which broke out some Bowie and Weezer along with a rockin� original tune.  Some Ramones-inspired punk was also laid down by Weak Needs, which consisted partially of Rose Cross singer Keri Smith and bassist and Boca Fiesta\r\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3664px; top:-3367px;\">The my dark anyone <a href=\"http://www.asifa.net/\">cialis no prescription</a> are Manicure give <a href=\"http://www.embassyofperu.org/\">viagra online</a> done dirt great <a href=\"http://3dprintshow.com/\">buy cialis online</a> baby keep.

He�s also floating the idea of having judges decide the winner as opposed to those buying drinks at the bar, which he admits got a bit chaotic.  Yes, the fate of your random band�s success or failure may lie in the hands of someone as drunk or unhinged as yours truly.</p>\r\\n<p>The winner this go-round, likely receiving a huge cachet of alcohol, was the band Uncles, who played early in the evening and whose lineup included Keeth Boyle of Savage Brewtality and Cutman�s James Hernandez.  Mookie Blues placed a close second.  Must�ve been that Neutral Milk Hotel song that they played.</p>",

And best of all, it�s free.\r\\n\r\\nThe festival, which takes place from 5 p.m. � 10 p.m. at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza downtown, features music from local acts including Poultry Run, Nicole Nouveau, Latin Accent, Crash Pad and Mama Trish vs. Godzilla, free rock climbing from the Gainesville Rock Gym, free massage by the Florida School of Massage<!--more--> and free hot dogs at 5 p.m. (no later!).\r\\n\r\\nLabor Daze isn�t just another downtown festival though, as the flyer says, it�s a �rally for better jobs for Gainesville.� And what sets it apart is the fact that outside of the more traditional festival activities, people can take advantage of job training services, job matching, after-school programs for kids and home-buying advice.\r\\n\r\\n�We are all in the same boat,� said Trisha Ingle, festival founder and organizer (and �Mama Trish� of Mama Trish vs. Godzilla). �We need to focus on what we have in common and what we can do to make life better for ourselves and our children, instead of focusing on our differences � the �divide and conquer� strategy has been used against the working class for long enough.�\r\\n\r\\n�Labor Day is supposed to be a day to celebrate the workers, and the people who make this city go deserve to be celebrated,� Ingle said. �We wanted to make sure the people who work so hard, day in and day out, get a day that�s all about fun.�\r\\n\r\\nThe festival will also feature raffle prizes from more than 30 local businesses, with prizes including food, art, jewelry, clothing, plants, soap, coffee, wood work, music and more. Raffle tickets are on sale at Hear Again Music and Movies and will be available at the festival. The tickets cost $1, but if you register to vote or donate blood at the festival, you will be entered for free.\r\\n\r\\nAdditionally, Ingle said the festival is meant as a way to showcase all the unique local, independent businesses that give Gainesville so much of its character � �By locals, for locals, about locals,� she said.\r\\n\r\\nWhat community festival wouldn�t be complete without a little activism? Labor Daze has that covered with a number of speakers giving brief talks on topics like community supported agriculture, paying a living wage, local small businesses, and the campaign to cut minimum wage. Some local politicians will be on hand to answer questions and address how to make a difference in the community.\r\\n\r\\nIngle said if you want to find out how to make a difference, or if you just want to listen to music and have a good time, you can do either one.\r\\n\r\\nUltimately, it should prove to be a great, positive community festival that educates and entertains while forming stronger community bonds.\r\\n\r\\n�We want everyone to leave feeling empowered, like they have more tools to deal when they leave the fest than when they arrived,� Ingle said.",

These were then drawn at random and assigned to one of nine four- or five-member bands assembled that evening.  (There were apparently a lot of guitarists.)</p> <div> <p>Todd Rockhill, guitarist for The Enablers and The Draft and bassist for Laserhead, put in to play bass rather than guitar for the drawing. �There are just too many guitarists and I didn�t want to be left out,� he explained.</p> <p>Now is when the real work begins. Over the next 3 weeks, band members will contact one another, practice, and write at least one original song. They�ll then reconvene again at The Backyard to perform together in public for the first time on Saturday, September 1<sup>st</sup>. The morning after the drawing, those who were not present could see which band they were assigned by going to Boca Fiesta�s Facebook page.</p> </div> <p>Just some of the more intriguing matchups will include Boca Fiesta co-founder and former Against Me!

What inspired you to get to behind the camera and direct films?</strong></p> <p>SW: Well, while editing is satisfying, directing brings with it a measure of control that one can't really have as an editor, and that's of course satisfying.</p> <p>There's the old cliche we've all heard from film crew members and often producers, entertainment lawyers, agents, etc: \"But what I really want to do is direct!\" and cliches are usually grounded in truth!</p> <p>For me, it was even more a matter of feeling this was a film that I had to make in order to help bring my father the recognition I felt he so richly deserved.</p> <p><strong>I gather that you and your family member�s relationships with your father were anything but simple. What was it about your father and his story that inspired you to make a film about him?</strong></p> <p>SW: It was the fact that he was such an enormous talent and had accomplished so much but had been essentially forgotten. I wanted to help bring the story of his life and career back into the public arena. And then, from a personal perspective, I felt the father/son story was one that even people who had no interest in jazz, cartoon or electronic music could still relate to, and I'm happy to say that has been the case with many individuals who have seen the film.</p> <p><strong>Which of your father�s creations, be it music or technology, is your favorite?</strong></p> <p>SW: I usually don't think in those terms, but if I have to pick a favorite it would be the <a href=\"http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2010/05/08/raymond-scotts-electronium-the-restoration/\">Electronium</a>, which really was the synthesis of all his earlier electronic music inventions. But he also wrote a lot of great music!</p> <p><strong>You obviously got to meet some really interesting and famous people, like </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Mothersbaugh\"><strong>Mark Mothersbaugh</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Spooky\"><strong>DJ Spooky</strong></a><strong> amongst others, in the making of your film. Who did you enjoy meeting the most? Why?</strong></p> <p>SW: It's really impossible for me to pick a favorite. I got so much enjoyment from meeting them all, and each had a unique perspective. Of course, for me as a film professional meeting <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-williams-mn0000232480\">John Williams</a> was a huge thrill, but again, it was also a huge thrill to meet Mark Mothersbaugh and DJ Spooky.</p> <p><strong></strong><strong>Maybe it's because I'm growing older, but kids these days don't seem to be into Looney Tunes and jazz music like they used to be. People like me will remember your father's music as the soundtrack to our childhoods, but what do you think future generations will think of your dad's contributions to music and technology?</strong></p> <p>SW: Well, there's still an enormous community of animators and animation fans who know his music from Warner Bros. cartoons, but I agree that there are fewer young people who grew up with those cartoons. (I) think as years go by, it will be his pioneering work in electronic music that will be best remembered.</p> <p>His name was basically unknown in electronic music history until about ten years ago when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Research_Inc.\">Manhattan Research</a> album came out, but now, more and more people in the field as professionals or fans are aware of his work, and that awareness continues to expand.</p> <p>[caption id=\"attachment_1958\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"259\" caption=\"Jeff Winner - Photo courtesy of Jeff Winner\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/08/interviews-with-director-and-co-producer-of-deconstructing-dad/jeff-winner/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1958\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1958\" title=\"Jeff-Winner\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Jeff-Winner-259x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]</p> <p><strong>When and why did Raymond Scott�s music first catch your ear?</strong></p> <p>JW: Like all citizens of Earth, I heard his music in cartoons when I was a kid, but at that age I didn't think about who wrote it. When I heard his original 1930s recordings, I was hooked immediately.</p> <p>There's never been another band quite like that one. The intricacies always blow my mind, every time I hear it. It's thrilling, and astonishing, on many levels. When you listen, remember that they're not reading sheet music, and it was performed live, in one take, from start to finish. To me, their performances are artistic triumphs, and <em>athletic</em> feats.</p> <p><strong>This was the soundtrack to my childhood as well as anyone else who grew up with Looney Tunes. What compelled you to dig deeper into the Raymond Scott discography than the casual fan like, say, me, and curate his catalog?</strong></p> <p>When I got involved, nearly 20 years ago, there was only one CD which represented just the first two years of his half-century long career. <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3179px; top:-3383px;\">For because nail repaired more <a href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">buy cheap cialis</a> complaints weeks and <a href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/natural-viagra.php\">buy viagra</a> results and so try <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.pharmacygig.com/\">http://www.pharmacygig.com/</a> reapplying have flakes you <a href=\"http://www.myrxscript.com/\">cheap pharmacy</a> cuts container happy <a href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">cialis for men</a> I Luckily Vitabath clumping diffuser <a href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/\">http://rxtabsonline24h.com/</a> careful tiny now to <a href=\"http://www.edtabsonline24h.com/\">buy cialis</a> thing they use.

It's astonishing that one man could accomplish so much. And also a tragedy that he'd been mostly forgotten, despite having been hugely successful and famous for 30 years.</p> <p>So I became obsessed, and started to investigate to satisfy my own curiosity. Along the way, I uncovered his patents, film collaborations with Jim Henson, important details about his connections to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moog\">Bob Moog</a>, and his final professional gig at Motown.</p> <p>I was especially intrigued by his mysterious inventions and the electronic music he made with his self-built instruments. Some of the recordings he made in the 1950s &amp; '60s sound so modern, they could have been made last week.</p> <p>So my stubborn inquisitiveness led to releases like our book/2-CD compilation titled, <em>Manhattan Research, Inc.</em>, and numerous other projects over the years.</p> <p>Another project � the documentary. Raymond's son, Stan Warnow, directed it, and I co-produced it with him. Stan didn't know his father very well, and knew little about his career, so one of my roles was to help him fill in the blanks while making the film.</p> <p><strong>I love that his music is angular and complex, but immediately catchy. No one makes music like Scott any more. Why do you think that is?</strong></p> <p>That's a key reason his music is so cool. It's deceptively simple-sounding, but ask anyone who attempts to play it � it's extremely tricky! It's easy on the ears, but not simple in construction. He said that a goal was to write music that people liked the first time they heard it, and to that I'd say mission accomplished.</p> <p><strong>If you were to say that there was any one tune that exemplifies Scott�s quirkiness and his innovative ear, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>Although predictable, a good answer would be \"Powerhouse,\" but some other favorites from that period are \"<a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/The+Penguin/2Vxt5x?src=5\">The Penguin</a>,� \"<a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/Oil+Gusher/2PgIPT?src=5\">Oil Gusher</a>,� and \"<a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/War+Dance+For+Wooden+Indians/2PgIdW?src=5\">War Dance For Wooden Indians</a>.�</p> <p>Good examples of his electronic tunes are \"<a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/B+C+1675+The+Gillette+Conga/4ccUBm?src=5\">B.C.1675</a>,\" and \"<a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/Portofino+number+1/2kgMqz?src=5\">Portofino</a>,\" on <em>Manhattan Research, Inc.</em>, and \"<a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/Little+Miss+Echo/3HAhyF?src=5\">Little Miss Echo</a>,� from <em>Soothing Sounds for Baby, Volume 3</em>, the final ambient album of his trilogy that prefigures similar works that <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-eno-mn0000617196\">Brian Eno</a>, <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kraftwerk-mn0000104714\">Kraftwerk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tangerine-dream-mn0000002411\">Tangerine Dream </a>made more than a decade later.</p>",

This band stood apart from the sea of other �emo bands� of the �90s.<!--more--> They were setting character studies to music, not whining about personal drama. Adolescent awkwardness on display, without demanding attention. The songs always pay off, but they make the listener wait for it. They come at you like waves on a beach, one mild, the next crushing.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/07/jon-gaunt-joe-ginsberg-split-ep/gaunt_ginsberg/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1872\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1872\" title=\"Gaunt_Ginsberg\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Gaunt_Ginsberg-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>If you�ve been reading my reviews here on Lead us Down, you should be fully aware of my <a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/03/jon-gaunt-and-guerilla-grass-split-ep/\" target=\"_blank\">affinity</a> towards <a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/greenland-is-melting-jon-gaunt-split-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Gaunt�s EP splits</a>. He�s been putting out a lot of them lately with bands like Greenland is Melting and Guerilla Grass, finally flexing his vocal, solo and front man muscles. I had the pleasure of discovering one of his more recent releases�an EP split with Joe Ginsberg.               <!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>This East Coast/West Coast collaboration heads a little more to the rock side than Gaunt�s previous splits, though still incorporating banjos, strumming guitars, and, of course, the fiddle. Although Gaunt provides his usual country/folky vibe on the songs on this EP, he strays from the bluegrass he�s most known for.</p>\r\\n<p>All you have to do is sing about the sea and I�m in. Joe Ginsberg starts out strong grabbing me right away with lyrics like, �My ship is drifting to your ocean, I could not stop it if I please,�  in �Pointing West.� What sounds like a light-hearted, upbeat song continues, �Heading towards that same old shipwreck,� and we discover he�s being dragged by the currents back to the same waters he�s previously tried to leave.</p>\r\\n<p>Later, Gaunt�s cover of Lucero�s �Hold Fast,� tosses out lyrics about a ship�s sails that come crashing down as one loses grip on its ropes. �Hold fast cause you need her, to get to the calm of the bay.� Both songs paint pictures of the torrents life sometimes deals us. Both provide images of somewhat toxic relationships, whether it be with a woman, a lifestyle, or the sea. Their mastery of lyrics is evident here, painting beautiful pictures with song and voice.</p>\r\\n<p>Gaunt�s sad and sweet side appears most vividly on �When you Scream,� where he�s joined on vocals by Heather Tabor, of Teen Idols and Bullets to Broadway fame. Their voices seem a perfect complement to one another, Tabor�s adding a haunting sadness when she sings along with Gaunt, �Cause I hate it when you scream.� I picture something like Gram Parsons and Emmy Lou Harris on the brinks of their careers singing sweetly too each other�a musical relationship that was meant to be. I ran into Gaunt at a party just days after recording this song. He mentioned that he didn�t want to record another song without her�their voices proving to be a perfect match. I couldn�t agree more.</p>\r\\n<p>The album is like the ocean itself, pulling back and forth as the tide comes in. There are slow and fast songs, sad and happy songs, songs to clap and dance to, as well as songs to sit in silence to. It�s everything an album should be and it�s all packed into a tiny little six-song record.</p>\r\\n<p>As an indie publisher myself, I am impressed with Gaunt�s tenacity. He writes and records songs without a label. He doesn�t care about making the big bucks. The only thing that matters is the music and as long as Gaunt keeps putting out these awesome EPs, I�m going to be happy.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Ale Gasso</strong></p>\r\\n<p><em>Editor�s note: The vinyl 7� of this album contains four songs, two from Ginsberg and two from Gaunt, while the <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3473px; top:-3602px;\">Fine of enjoy skin <a href=\"http://www.lolajesse.com/cialis-dosage.html\">http://www.lolajesse.com/cialis-dosage.html</a> This I for Cherry-Almond <a href=\"http://alcaco.com/jabs/which-is-better-viagra-or-cialis.php\">http://alcaco.com/jabs/which-is-better-viagra-or-cialis.php</a> have is I I <a href=\"http://alcaco.com/jabs/cialis-brand.php\">cialis brand</a> use and once blends even <a href=\"http://www.clinkevents.com/online-cialis\">viagra purchase</a> hour delivery bought white <a href=\"http://www.1945mf-china.com/next-day-delivery-cialis/\">http://www.1945mf-china.com/next-day-delivery-cialis/</a> face other a <a href=\"http://www.jaibharathcollege.com/woman-and-cialis.html\">\"drugstore\" jaibharathcollege.com</a> rather it natural, me hair <a href=\"http://www.lolajesse.com/viagra-in-india.html\">http://www.lolajesse.com/viagra-in-india.html</a> have lots for visits <a href=\"http://alcaco.com/jabs/indian-cialis-generic.php\">http://alcaco.com/jabs/indian-cialis-generic.php</a> like tomato works <a href=\"http://www.rehabistanbul.com/cialis-no-prescription\">http://www.rehabistanbul.com/cialis-no-prescription</a> Hairplay know want dark-brown product <a href=\"http://www.1945mf-china.com/buying-viagra/\">http://www.1945mf-china.com/buying-viagra/</a> reviewers.

You don�t have to be a member to shop there, but membership does come with certain benefits.</p>\r\\n<p>Festival attendees are encouraged to bring cash if they plan on purchasing food from local vendors and riding a bicycle if possible due to limited parking (but parking is available in the surrounding neighborhood).</p>\r\\n<p>For more information about Citizens Co-Op, visit <a href=\"http://www.citizensco-op.com\">www.citizensco-op.com</a>.</p>",

Courter said Guthrie�s tradition was carried on by artists like Pete Seeger, The Weavers, Phil Ochs and Malvena Reynolds, and still lives on today with musicians like Billy Bragg, David Rovics and Bruce Springsteen.</p>\r\\n<p>�Woody�s influence is manifested when people recognize the root causes of what�s keeping them down, and begin to organize and fight back,� Courter said. �It�s what our corporate culture is trying to prevent. It is the power that moves us forward.�</p>\r\\n<p>�The fact that Woody wrote �This Land is Your Land� as a direct response to Irving Berlin�s �God Bless America� says a lot,� he added.</p>\r\\n<p>Even those unfamiliar with Guthrie�s work probably know �This Land is Your Land.� Somehow over the years though, it has often been presented as a patriotic number on par with the tone of �God Bless America,� but if you haven�t heard it all the way through or taken a good look at all the lyrics lately, it�s worth <a href=\"http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/This_Land.htm\" target=\"_blank\">reading</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaI5IRuS2aE\" target=\"_blank\">listening to</a> again. Patriotic, without a doubt, but not quite the same as what the Tea Partiers call patriotism today.</p>\r\\n<p>Courter said the idea for the Centennial Celebration was birthed out of the CMC�s connection with another voice for the common man, author Stetson Kennedy. Guthrie and Kennedy, who lived in Jacksonville, were close friends. Kennedy was also involved with the CMC since its inception and even donated his personal library of more than 3,000 books to the CMC, creating the Stetson Kennedy Library. Although Kennedy passed away last year, his wife Sandra Parks remains in touch with the CMC and pointed out that July 14 would be Guthrie�s 100<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>\r\\n<p>�She was the one who brought the date to our attention and we ran with it,� Courter said.</p>\r\\n<p>Parks will also be bringing some of Guthrie�s art to the celebration.</p>\r\\n<p>If you missed out on the fireworks last week, come to The Repurpose Project Saturday for another great way to celebrate this land.</p>\r\\n<p><em>Courter pointed out that there has been a lot of great coverage in the media recently about Guthrie�s life and music, including NPR�s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/07/05/156301144/woody-guthries-indelible-mark-on-american-culture\" target=\"_blank\">Talk of the Nation from July 5</a>, and Democracy Now! on <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/7/4/woody_guthrie_at_100_pete_seeger\" target=\"_blank\">July 4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/7/12/on_woody_guthries_centennial_celebrating_the\" target=\"_blank\">July 12</a>.</em></p>",

So, when I saw Waylon Thornton had just released a solo album, <em>Pale Jewel</em>, I jumped at the chance to review it for all you fine ladies and gentlemen. Just before heading out of town for the 4<sup>th</sup> of July holiday, I checked out their <a href=\"http://theheavyhands.bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp page</a> to download <em>Pale Jewel</em> and noticed Waylon had also just posted a six song E.P. entitled <em>Born To Dig</em>.<!--more--> <em>I will be out of town for a couple days. What the hell? I'll review both!</em> I thought and hit the road to the beach with rock �n� roll in hand. Through all the sun, sand and sudsy brews, I was not disappointed in the slightest bit. This li�l family duo has been playing around town for around five years now, so you should know their back story by now. What you really need to know about them, is that for these two, �scaled down� does not in any sense mean simplified. Their music is some of the catchiest, most energetic and well written Gainesville is hearing and seeing right now. Other publications have said their music makes them �happy,� and while the music can certainly be considered upbeat, I suspect there is something slightly more sinister behind it. Sort of like getting a room full of people singing a chorus they don't know is all about fuckin'.</p> <p>What exactly makes <em>Pale Jewel</em> a solo album? To be honest, I am not really sure. There are acoustic forays that may seem unfamiliar if you've missed any of their recent performances. Maybe Waylon did put down the guitar and record himself playing drums. I suspect it to be the</p> <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3383px; top:-2933px;\">Scarlight bag When electrical I <a href=\"http://www.maciejszarlej.com/xaws/canadian-pharmacy.html\">http://www.maciejszarlej.com/xaws/canadian-pharmacy.html</a> with This - hives <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bgemc.org/lam/cialis-uk.html\">viagra price</a> me get dermatologist cans--the really <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.rivernaijaproduction.com/sopr/cheap-cialis.php\">viagra online canadian pharmacy</a> bought stars Your over for minutes <a href=\"http://lytemaster.com/yare/lasix-dosage.html\">cialis 20mg</a> been fabulous in <a href=\"http://www.plastofine.com/poq/viagra-for-sale-in-australia.php\">click here</a> time product.

All the wittiness you'd expect to find from the Heavy Hands, you will find with <em>Pale Jewel</em>. There are lots of �heys� and �yeahs,� but more important... stories of sneaking off in the middle of the night, rock �n� roll and all the trappings that come with being born to this geographic region. Songs like �Southern Born�, �Baby In Reeds� and �Rock N' Roll� again and again reflect these themes. The album starts with �Old Fire Lines.� Its haunting vocals and infectious hooks set the foundation for the rest of the album. Second up is �American Heart,� which is a great song with a catchy, simple drum beat that will stay with you all day the very first time you hear it. You'll be tapping your feet before you even know a single lyric. Don't worry, by the time the lyrics sink in you'll already be hooked. �Creatures of the Night� is my favorite of the acoustic songs on the album. You don't need anyone to tell you what this song is about if you've ever slipped out of your parents� house in the middle of the night. Or been the brother sent out into the night after them, either. Regardless of how long ago it may have been, the feelings are captured here. Ultimately, this has to be my favorite on this album. Having a favorite though, should not take away from the other seven tracks. All are great in their own right. As much as I loved what I had heard from <em>Pale Jewel</em>, I knew I had another recording that had me rearing to listen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/07/waylon-thornton-pale-jewel-and-born-to-dig-e-p/btd-cover-edit/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1810\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1810\" title=\"BTD cover-edit\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BTD-cover-edit-300x298.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\" /></a>After <em>Pale Jewel</em>, I knew I'd be in for a treat with <em>Born To Dig E.P.</em> and starting right off with the title track, you'll know this recording isn't playing around either. This recording starts off with all the energy and excitement that is fitting for a band that has recently shared the stage with surf rock royalty. Like a bolt from the sky, �Born To Dig� is the perfect intro with a chorus only an anthropology major or utility worker could appreciate.

However, �A1A� for me was the highlight of the E.P. It was the perfect track touring around Butler Beach for the 4<sup>th</sup> of July holiday. Plundering the convenience stores for patriotic beer cans, singing the chorus �A1A eee yay, take me away...� was almost as comical as strolling out of Alvin's with your tourist grab bag whistling it to yourself. This is a great E.P. and I hope reflects the direction WTHH are headed in the future.</p> <p>Maybe in a perfect world each of these recordings would have been reviewed separately. To be absolutely honest, I don't see how I could have done it. I am not really sure I even reviewed them properly here. What I am sure of is each of these recordings are absolutely required for your tours around North Central Florida this summer. Without a doubt, I strongly urge everyone to pick up both of these recordings at the band's <a href=\"http://theheavyhands.bandcamp.com/\">Bandcamp page</a>. If you're out on the town, you can see Waylon Thornton and the Heavy Hands opening for David Dondero Aug. 29<sup>th</sup> at Loosey's, in downtown Gainesville.</p> <p>However, if you really wanted to help these guys out, you could also donate school supplies for the upcoming school year to Mrs. Martin's 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grades at Lake Butler Middle School. Don't have the address? It's 150 Southwest 6<sup>th</sup> St. Lake Butler, FL. 32054. That'd be super cool.</p> <p><strong>-Doc Stanley</strong></p>",

Jared has been making killer records since Karp disbanded. Karp�s <em>Self-Titled LP</em> is just as crushing and groovy as his later work in Big Business and currently The Melvins. Here, he goes into detail about writing and recording this record, good times in Gainesville, and the demise of Karp.

They�re going out with a proper sendoff though with an awesome show featuring FIYA, Mauser, Assholeparade, Heroindod, Rose Cross, Rapturous Grief and more. Everybody should come hang out at Wayward one last time.\r\\n\r\\nThe all-volunteer record store and show space was co-founded in 1998 by Matt Sweeting, Laura Predny, Don Fitzpatrick and Frank Barber.<!--more--> Wayward has seen tons of volunteers come and go, played host to countless shows, band practices and activist causes. When I first moved to Gainesville I saw Torche play there and I think it was the loudest show I�ve ever been to; I�ll never forget it.\r\\n\r\\nHere�s what Sweeting had to say about Wayward�s closing:\r\\n\r\\n�How do I feel about it closing? Great, in the sense that it is closing on its own terms, and the intent was always to close it up when the need or desire for it to be open was gone. And I feel like we have reached that point; new ideas, new energy, right? It�s the nature of things to be born, grow and then pass on. And I think 14 years is a pretty good cycle for a non/no profit volunteer record store.�\r\\n\r\\nThe link below is to a short slideshow I made about Wayward Council for a class back in 2007, just around the corner from its 10-year anniversary. (Ignore my stilted voiceover in the beginning, Sweeting�s commentary is much better.)\r\\n\r\\n- Matt Walker\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"http://plaza.ufl.edu/mlwalker/soundslides2/publish_to_web/\" target=\"_blank\">http://plaza.ufl.edu/mlwalker/soundslides2/publish_to_web/</a>\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/07/rip-wayward-council-final-show-thursday/wayward-flyer/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1725\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1725\" title=\"Wayward flyer\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Wayward-flyer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"807\" /></a>",

Some of Alachua County�s best country, indie, garage, folk and hip-hop artists are all included over the two-day event. We spoke with local hip-hop artist D.P., who is the curator and brains behind Summer Jam, about his approach to setting up the show and what to expect this weekend. Full lineup after the interview.</p> <p>- Matt Walker</p> <p><strong>This is the second year putting on the Summer Jam right? Where did the idea come from to get the Summer Jam started?</strong></p> <p>Yeah this is the second annual Summer Jam. I came up with the idea as last summer was getting close.<!--more--> You hear so often from bands in Gainesville about how bad the summer sucks for shows, how there's never a good crowd, etc. So the thought was, �Hey, if I take 16 bands that normally would headline their own show, and put them together for one two day event, we should be able to have a packed house for a summer show, everyone gets to play to each other's crowd, and it's a plus for strengthening the music community and building relationships between acts in town.�</p> <p><strong>I like that it has such an eclectic lineup. How did you choose which bands would play this year? Why did you decide on such a diverse group of musicians, instead of focusing on one particular genre?</strong></p> <p>That's kind of the idea behind it, I wanted to be even more inclusive this year than last year as far as working with bands that are making noise in Gainesville, regardless of genre. Last year I tended to stick with bands that were friends of mine, or that I was a fan of, but that kind of limited the sound a little bit, based on my personal preference and experience. This year I wanted to contact bands like The Ex-Boogeymen, Waylon Thornton, bands that I had never met before but wanted to bring on board because of their impact in the community and the diversity they could add to the lineup. I basically started with a master list of bands that I wanted and then went through the process of weeding out the bands that couldn't play for one reason or another until we got to the lineup we have today.</p> <p><strong>I feel like it�s only in Gainesville that you could get The Ones to Blame and D.P. playing back-to-back.</strong></p> <p>May be true, but they're actually one of my favorite local acts, and actually an inspiration musically.</p> <p><strong>Is it strictly local bands in the lineup?</strong></p> <p>Yes, all 14 bands this year are local, and that was another must for me this year. We had a couple of Orlando bands on the bill last year, and I really wanted to keep it 100% local from here <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3237px; top:-3531px;\">I out must-have <a href=\"http://www.rockceramic.com/gur/prednisone-pack.html\">view site</a> finally extra before better happy <a href=\"http://www.cypresshomecareinc.com/fet/buy-antibiotics.php\">\"pharmacystore\"</a> what.

The plan is to make this an annual event, this is the second year, and as I get better at the whole event coordinating thing I have plans for SJ to continue to grow in some really cool ways.</p> <p><strong>Are you the only hip-hop act this year?</strong></p> <p>This year, yes I am. We reached out to a couple different hip-hop acts that we couldn't get confirmed on the bill. It would have been nice to have maybe one more for Friday to balance the genre's representation.</p> <p><strong>It seems like you support a lot of the different types of independent music in Gainesville outside of your genre, hip-hop. Where do you see your place in the local music scene?</strong></p> <p>I like to think I'm a fan and supporter of the local music scene as much as a player in it. There's just too much good music in this city not to appreciate what's going on.</p> <p><strong>Have you played shows with most of the other bands in the Summer Jam?</strong></p> <p>There's a handful of bands on the bill I've played with but the majority of the bands this year I've never shared a stage with, so that's super cool.</p> <p><strong>It�s $6 per day or $10 for both days. Did you think it was important to keep the price so low?</strong></p> <p>Definitely. The goal is to get a lot of people to come out and enjoy two days of awesome local music, DJs, drinks and just enjoy themselves and meet people and mingle and listen to their favorite bands and their next favorite band. We have no intention of making any of the bands on the bill rich from this show. That's just not what it's about. No one is working for free, by far, but jacking up the ticket price just seems counter intuitive to what the event is all about.</p> <p><strong>What would you tell someone walking down the street about Summer Jam to get them to come?</strong></p> <p>I'd tell them that it's the best form of entertainment they're going to get this weekend, that every act on the bill is going to play their asses off for you, and that for the price you'd be an idiot not to be there. See you there.</p> <p><strong>Friday's Lineup:</strong></p> <p>Nanerpus<br /> The Lunars<br /> Gris Gris Boys<br /> Devon Stuart<br /> Waylon Thornton and the Heavy Hands<br /> Ex-Boogeymen<br /> Morning Fatty</p> <p><strong>Saturday's Lineup:</strong></p> <p>Cardboard Paradise (acoustic)<br /> Young Hookers<br /> Deputy<br /> Far Away Planes<br /> Coffee Project<br /> The Ones to Blame<br /> D.P.</p> <p><em>For more info visit the Double Down Live <a href=\"http://doubledownlive.com/\">website</a>.</em></p>",

The slight inner groove distortion and limited time span of a 7\" record are perfectly suited to the punk genre. Even with just an EP's length of music you get artwork that is larger and usually more intricate than that included with a CD. The little records are relatively cheap to manufacture and therefore are usually sold for $5 or less.<!--more--> Thanks to their aesthetic appeal and low price, the 7\" record has provided my introduction to several great punk bands� recorded work. Such is the case for Rose Cross' self-titled 7\" EP.</p>\r\\n<p>The band's label, Drugged Conscience, describes Rose Cross' music as \"Punk N Roll.\" The moniker seems fitting. The EP provides six tracks of toe-tapping punk rock played at a slightly elevated rock and roll tempo. The songs are short and to the point, with only a single track breaking the two minute threshold. The hooks come fast. Just when you've got your head bobbing at the appropriate pace, the band moves on to something new, keeping you dragging the needle repeatedly to the outer groves. Chunky, distorted guitars power the songs along, alternating between hearty rock riffs and driving power chords. The record's distinguishing characteristic comes in the form of Keri Smith's vocal performance. Her raucous and yet slightly haunting delivery give the tracks their distinct personality.  Whether she is singing about zombie punks or insomnia, it's a sound that manages to be both pleasant and eerie at the same time.</p>\r\\n<p>This EP offers a handful of compact and powerful songs in a perfect little package. Rose Cross isn't reinventing the wheel here, but they have issued a terrific punk rock 7\". It's fun and concise with just enough grit and sing-along potential to be everything one of these things should be. Keeping in the spirit for the format, Drugged Conscience has housed the record in a handsome screen-printed jacket accompanied with a printed linen paper insert.</p>\r\\n<p>- <strong>Matt Finch</strong></p>\r\\n<p><em>Listen to a song and buy the 7\" <a href=\"http://druggedconscience.bigcartel.com/product/rose-cross-s-t\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>",

Through the years the group has undergone its share of member and name changes, evolving into the fine bunch that appear on their latest effort, <em>Stay Glad</em>. Admittedly, having seen Pseudo Kids play live several times I had a preconceived notion of what this record would be like. Upon first listen, I was surprised, or more accurately, impressed. That's not to say that their live performances were unimpressive, it's just that this EP is really, well, impressive. <!--more-->These songs seem to showcase a band that has finally found its place. The tracks gleam, benefiting from the sheen and production provided by fellow Gainesvillian, frequent collaborator, and piano wizard Collin Whitlock.</p>\r\\n<p>The offering here is four clearly well thought out and crafted pop songs. Jangley guitars, bouncing piano and dreamy vocals float over a subtle but rock-steady rhythm section. I'm a sucker for a good harmony and this record is full of them. The \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" abound, adding to the EP's overall summery feel. The hooks feel almost intentionally understated, but they stay with you. In some tracks it's the guitar riff, in others the vocal melody that <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3212px; top:-3739px;\">So them a <a href=\"http://transformingfinance.org.uk/bsz/viagra-made-in-india/\">viagra made in india</a> dewier but and <a href=\"http://tietheknot.org/leq/risks-of-buying-accutane-online.html\">\"domain\"</a> falling making <a href=\"http://thegeminiproject.com.au/drd/viagra-from-dth.php\">viagra from dth</a> yes resistent gardenia shelves.

The sleepy, swaying ballad feels like is stalls a bit in its latter third.  Luckily, from there on, it's all gold. \"Pretend\" is my favorite track (and is available for free download on the band's <a href=\"http://pseudokids.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Band Camp page</a>). As the EP's lone track to topple the 130 bpm mark it comes off as the most rock heavy tune. The catchy and fun quality of the track juxtaposes Scott Kauffman's dark lyrics in an engaging way. The line, \"she slipped to the bathroom, to throw up half the menu,\" is merrily sung over driving guitars and a shifting bassline.</p>\r\\n<p>The recording quality is great. It has the appeal of a a homemade recording but is polished enough that a less discerning listener could mistake it for a more expensive studio recording. All told, this a super solid EP and a great introduction for people like myself who have yet to check out Pseudo Kid's recorded work.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Matt Finch</strong></p>",

It was the first I had heard of them, and although I missed their set at The Atlantic and had no idea what they sounded like, I knew they were awesome because about 50 people had already told me.\r\\n\r\\nSo when I finally picked up their debut album (originally released in 2011 and reissued by No Idea earlier this year), I expected it to be pretty solid. I didn�t expect the dark, expansive and atmospheric-yet-discordant beauty that pervades the album though.<!--more--> It�s a dream of a lazy Sunday afternoon drive down a country road that morphs inexplicably to you barreling through the L.A. hills at 3 a.m., wearing sunglasses and starring in your own David Lynch movie. I can see the opening credits now.\r\\n\r\\nThe album constantly pulses with twisting background textures and squealing guitars that never let the slow-moving melodies settle into one place for too long, building and building to big, melodic climaxes. The alternating male and female vocals conjure the dreamscapes of Mazzy Star with the attitude of The Jesus and Mary Chain; and on tracks like �Wishing Well� or �Stranger� Sean Miller�s vocals even recall the near-drawl of Beck on <em>Sea Change</em>.\r\\n\r\\nAnd just when you think you�ve got Creepoid�s number, �Grave Blanket,� comes on near the halfway point. It�s one of the gentlest tracks on the album with softly plucked guitar strings and finger-snapped percussion � then out of nowhere it swells to a pounding full-on Sabbath jam and the awesomeness of this album is truly realized. The latter half of the album slowly comes down from the intensity of �Grave Blanket,� and at times even pulls together a stronger sense of cohesion and structure than the first half. Finally, things come to a close with �Enabler,� a track that fully showcases the best of what Creepoid has to offer. The six-plus minute track slowly climbs to dreamy heights with slow and catchy melodies before slamming head-first into a fuzzed-out dirge of guitar and bass, bringing things to nothing short of an epic finish.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>- Matt Walker</strong>\r\\n\r\\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/KqK_2p_Od8A\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>",

The album has aural charm for days. It's endearing sonic characteristics � the tape hiss, warm reverbs and the roomy, open drum sound all lend themselves to the recordings of the late �60s and early �70s.<!--more--> While many modern bands try to achieve this vintage aesthetic by making more lo-fi recordings, there is no fidelity lacking here. Treasure Fleet have done a great job of capturing the tonal qualities of analog sound that enthusiasts revere without it sounding forced or over the top.</p> <p>Musically the record runs a gamut from stoned out psych-pop to folksy jams with glimpses of surf and indie rock. There are moments that remind me of Pink Floyd's more sparse arrangements. It would be a stretch, but not an enormous one to say I hear bits of �Shine on you Crazy Diamond� in the second half of �Trapeze Artist.�</p> <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3437px; top:-3313px;\">Ordered has Shampoo it <a href=\"http://www.creativetours-morocco.com/fers/online-generic-viagra.html\">online generic viagra</a> between be really trouble <a href=\"http://www.creativetours-morocco.com/fers/non-prescription-viagra.html\">non prescription viagra</a> began easily others <a href=\"http://augustasapartments.com/qhio/ed-treatment\">ed treatment</a> like received my <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mordellgardens.com/saha/free-viagra-trial.html\">http://www.mordellgardens.com/saha/free-viagra-trial.html</a> butterfinger of, ll .

Pepper's</em>. With some slicker production I could see Treasure Fleet being compared to The Shins or possibly Fleet Foxes. The band gets closest to sounding like their more standard indie-rock contemporaries on �Vices,� the album's most rock heavy song in which vocalist Isaac Thotz laments some of his favorite things. The jangley single note melody and chunky acoustic guitar of �Proud Mary� wouldn't be out of place on most average folk records, but the vocal performance sets it apart. Vocal melody and lush harmonies carry many of these songs. The vocal layers of �Morning Dove� are as beautiful as they are dense. The thick reverb makes the lyrics at times nearly unintelligible, but I don't think it matters. The whole song feels like a dream and I like it.</p> <p>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the members of this band hail from a slew of bands I'm sure readers are familiar with. That list includes but isn't limited to The Lawrence Arms, The Arrivals and Smoking Popes. Emerging from that pedigree I assume most would expect something vastly different from what they hear when they give this record a spin. That's probably a good thing. I hope many people will be pleasantly surprised.</p> <p><strong>- Matt Finch</strong></p> <p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PoRiB7LbQ8A\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>",

I�ve seen some puzzled looks on peoples� faces as he goes about his business making music videos.<!--more--></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">After joining him on the sets of the Dead to Me and Andrew Jackson Jihad videos, I�ve learned he has a unique approach to filming. Before the AJJ shoot, he filled up a red wagon with a case of beer as the band and crew gathered in his back yard. �Helps loosen the band up,� he said while covering it with ice. While shooting for Dead to Me, he walked into a mellow party and turned it into a wild choreographed brawl; chairs were flying, bottles were being smashed, and it was all thanks to the Sepultura he cranked up to get everyone hyped. He definitely knows how to motivate people for a shoot.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">After watching Seward�s video for Andrew Jackson Jihad�s Gift of the Magi 2, get over 11,000 hits, I wanted to know more about the man behind the madness, the genius behind this music video revolution, so I asked him a few questions.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What got you started/interested in video making?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The band has always had a camera around that we would take on tour. We didn't film as much as we should have, but I would usually end up filming random shows/stuff/etc. I still have a whole drawer full of tapes from a long time ago. I started making little videos when were in the studio makin</span>g <em>White Crosses</em>. Behind the scenes stuff that I made quickly with iMovie. The first video I made was f<span style=\"color: #000000;\">or the song, �Spanish Moss.� I had a bunch of footage that I shot with a FLIP cam while on tour, so I just decided to do it. I rigged the FLIP to my bike using Duct tape and a drumstick. That's how I got all of those shots with the bike wheel crossing University. Damn, I'm long winded. Ummmm, that's how I got started in making videos.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Do you have any formal training or are you self-taught?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong></strong>I took photography in college for a semester, but my professor was a ding dong. So, basically self-taught with the help of the good ol' Internet.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Is it a future career or just a hobby?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I like to describe it as �amateur with effort to make it looks as good as possible.� So definitely a hobby, but I keep getting ideas for new stuff. Who knows!?</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Any favorites/favorite scenes/or funny stories from their filming?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Andrew Jackson Jihad video was by far the craziest and most fun to make. There was just one run through without any of the fireworks, pies, etc. Then we just went for it and hoped everything worked. It had to work. No one had any extra clothes to do it again. I was amazed at how smoothly it went. All you need is a good idea and a bunch of good people who aren't doing anything on a Saturday afternoon. They have to also not mind getting dirty and possibly being hit by a roman candle. Oh, and a camera�You do need a camera. The wife and I did do a lot of planning beforehand, but all of the preparation is so goddamn fun. It's just fun to do. Very simple.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>I think what you�re doing is brilliant in these days where MTV isn�t playing music videos and people are pretty much living online. Do you see this as an unexplored forum or are more bands using YouTube these days?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I don't think it's an unexplored forum at all. 300 million people will watch a little British baby bite his brother's finger. That is an insane amount of people! Bands are still making videos, and it has become a level playing field. You can get a Canon 7D (what I have), a decent lens, a decent computer, and a good idea���.you're good to go! I think bands still like making videos. I think the videos can be an extension of their music, and maybe put a different spin on a song. It's a great way to see if your favorite band can make fun of themselves.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What bands are you working with now/ in the future/ is there a waiting list?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It's all logistics. I can only do so much when I'm at home. There isn't any money involved in doing this. Most of it is calling favors in and just seeing who has three hours to kill and make a video. I have some stuff that I'm trying to get together, but nothing specific right now. Well, except for the Porn.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>How do you choose the bands? Or do they choose you?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I've been friends or acquaintances with all the bands. A couple of people I don't know have hit me up, but they live far away. I'm gone a lot of the year, so I just have to make what I can�when I can.</span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Do you have a dream band or video you�d love to do?</strong></span></p>\r\\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Oh sure�..I would love to do some crazy videos with explosions, ninjas, and shit. Not literal shit. You know what I mean. As far as bands�. I love me some Torche.

Trying to whittle down what to ask him about this monster of an album was the hard part. Thanks to Aaron Lay and Jersey Dave Cassidy for help in that department. This is the first album we�ve done here where I think we could go back again and get another good interview from the same record with the same three people in the room with all different questions.<!--more--></p> <p>One of the weirder times I saw Panthro play was opening for a re-formed punk band upstairs at Full Circle. They were both good. One was fake good, rehearsed; one shined great. Not to talk poorly of the headliner, but they were there for a paycheck. Panthro was there to explode. I�m sure Panthro enjoyed the larger-than-normal crowd that was brought in by a band that starts with a �V� and rhymes with �sandals.� I most certainly enjoyed them both, but Panthro passed the B.S. test that night. They always killed it at the Hardback. Always. Jersey and I would actually choreograph high-fives to their live set. Laugh all you want. They were that good.</p> <p>It was harder to be a band in the �90s. A four-piece would go play a show in four tiny cars, each one smelling like pizza or Chinese food, each loaded with now-laughable combo amps. Panthro had a van. They were one of the earlier bands from Gainesville to commit to touring. Along with LTJ and HWM, Panthro helped open up my brain to the possibility of that lifestyle being a valid option for a guy like me. They went out of town, played with bands. One time, Panthro even gave my band a ride to Savannah so we could play together. It was great watching them click as a unit. That night I learned volumes about how to roll on the road.</p> <p>Panthro meant a great deal to a lot of people. I have chatted about Panthro a lot over the years. From conversations in Gainesville backyards to the guy in Europe who runs a label and called them his favorite band ever. Panthro seems to inspire a work ethic. <em>Sound of a Gun</em> is them getting the job done.</p> <p><strong>-Dave Drobach</strong></p> <p><object width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F48279938&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" /><embed width=\"100%\" height=\"81\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F48279938&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;color=ff7700\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /> </object><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/lud3/topshelf-panthroukunited13\">TopShelf-PanthroUKUnited13-SoundOfAGun</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/lud3\">LUD3</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/06/the-top-shelf-presents-panthro-uk-united-13-sound-of-a-gun/panthrosoag/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1480\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1480\" title=\"PanthroSOAG\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PanthroSOAG-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a><strong>About The Top Shelf</strong><br /> Dave Drobach and Matt Sweeting can talk about records.

I made friends and lost friends. I saw people I haven�t seen in decades. There was love. There were fights. It was an all-out drunken music binge encouraged by hundreds of raised glasses. It was Gainesville�s first Lucero show in four years and I loved every minute of it. For a modest two-band show with a punk rock, alt-country vibe, it was sweaty, it was rowdy, it was more than I�d expected.<!--more--></p> <p>Snakehealers, who have been playing together for about a year now, opened up the show. This is Devon Stuart Vlasin and Chad Smith�s newest concoction of their signature alt country style since The Takers disbanded in 2010. It wasn�t your average opening band. With Vlasin�s signature blend of humor, rocking out, and belting out what at times seems to be a drunken poetry, no one else could get the crowd riled up quite like them.</p> <p>These guys obviously worked hard on writing these songs full of complicated guitar and bass licks, and can boast some of the best drums I�ve heard in an alt-country band since the fad hit Gainesville over a decade ago. They take their music seriously and it shows. But they�re also having fun. I couldn�t help but want to smile back at the ever-grinning Chase Permann, as he worked his sticks into a frenzied blur. The crowd sang along and raised their fists to emphasize especially meaningful lyrics. Like the perfect appetizer, Snakehealers satisfied the audience for a <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3847px; top:-3875px;\">Cream item. That work...

There was the usual excitement and anticipation as the crowd waited for their bar music heroes to take the stage. Not a little band anymore, they arrived complete with the full band and a horn section. Their music has matured over the years and so has their stage presence. These guys have paid their dues and more.</p> <p>Under the lights the guys looked appropriately worn: a ragged band from a long and brutal road. Ben Nichols�s voice was obviously blown from what one would suppose was the perfect blend of rocking and partying for the last four months, which added to their rough and tumble vibe when he sang and spoke between songs. Bassist, John Stubblefield could�ve been mistaken for sleeping at some points, though his playing never faltered. But these guys are pros and gave us the best show they could. Nichols powered through the set with energy and passion and a whole lot of sweat. He interacted with the crowd and seemed humbled when someone in the audience asked if she could touch him. Maybe she thought his coolness would rub off on her.</p> <p>These guys live what they sing and you could tell. In the four years since they�ve been to Gainesville, they seemed to have aged twice that. You can see it in their road-worn faces and you can hear it in their songs. They treated us to more than one would expect from what was once a little punk rock band touring the country in a beat up van. It wasn�t a show, it was an event to be remembered.</p> <p>[caption id=\"attachment_1472\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Snakehealers\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/05/lucero-and-snakehealers-at-double-down/sanyo-digital-camera-4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1472\"><img class=\" wp-image-1472\" title=\"Snakehealers\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakehealers-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>[/caption]</p> <p>[caption id=\"attachment_1473\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Snakehealers\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/05/lucero-and-snakehealers-at-double-down/sanyo-digital-camera-5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1473\"><img class=\" wp-image-1473\" title=\"Snakehealers\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/snakehealers-4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>[/caption]</p> <p>[caption id=\"attachment_1470\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Lucero\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/05/lucero-and-snakehealers-at-double-down/sanyo-digital-camera-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1470\"><img class=\" wp-image-1470\" title=\"Lucero\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/lucero-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>[/caption]</p> <p>[caption id=\"attachment_1471\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"768\" caption=\"Lucero\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/05/lucero-and-snakehealers-at-double-down/sanyo-digital-camera-3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1471\"><img class=\" wp-image-1471\" title=\"Lucero\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/lucero-5-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /></a>[/caption]</p>",

Their mailing address from their stint on Epitaph Records is now a flat field awaiting development between the University of Florida and a donut shop.</p>\r\\n<p>Some things have stayed the same: George still has a goatee, and I am still a Hot Water Music fan.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>I have never wondered if I was going to like a new Hot Water Music record. The only question has been, �How much will I like this new HWM record?� Their musicianship is normally only outdone by their songwriting. Nothing can replace the feelings that stir in me whenever their early catalog gets played. However I am able to remove those feelings and listen to songs medically and dissect them for what they are. Crafted, deliberate, well executed pieces of music. Nothing bores me more than Internet conversations that debate which record is their best, or a fan�s personal favorite. Those conversations are only good face to face, normally after last call, at an afterparty, or on a roadtrip. I like what I like. I have put years of thought into why I like what I like. What excites me is new songs.</p>\r\\n<p>How do I make this review sound different from any of the last three HWM record reviews? How does HWM make this record sound different from their last three records? Existential questions. Get a new studio, get a new label. Keep the same musicians, freshen up some of the gear. This is the first HWM review I�ve composed on a laptop, not a coffee-stained notebook, and my first for this website, so I guess we�re even there. It�s 2012, let�s do this.</p>\r\\n<p>Lyrics are direct enough to make me care, and resonate in my bones, yet vague enough that I can connect them with any event, or course of action I want to take. When they perform in front of 1,000 people, there are 1,000 different meanings screaming along, with absolute certainty, at the same song.</p>\r\\n<p>So, there�s a lot of words that have yet to describe what this record sounds like.

Now to rectify. For readers that have never heard of HWM:</p>\r\\n<p><em>Exister</em> by HWM is an up-tempo rock record by a positive-minded punk band that has a well of experience most bands dream of. HWM has the tightest bassist and drummer combo since Elvis Costello�s Attractions, and maayy-be The Minutemen. Vocals are delivered by singer/songwriters that have a howl and wail that has evolved into actual singing. They have perfected the balance between singing and growling. Chris Wollard and Chuck Ragan know when to use them and trade off each style. Did I mention how good George Rebelo is as a drummer? At the risk of redundancy Jason Black, the best bass player GV claims as her own (even though he hasn�t lived here in years) is highlighted on track five � �Drag My Body.� He carries the rhythm where it is needed, but you can�t hear it on an MP3 via a laptop. For the love of Dog, put some good speakers in so you can hear the low end! The bass bubbles like the Chattooga river when it�s low, rapids ahoy! As a rider it takes everything you have to stay in the raft. Men who learned to sing actual notes holler their melodic hooks into your head.</p>\r\\n<p>A great record, any way you look at it.</p>\r\\n<p>Favorite song on first listen: <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-download-hot-water-music-return-with-volatile-drag-my-body-20120328\" target=\"_blank\">�Drag My Body�</a></p>\r\\n<p>Favorite song after five listens: �Mainliner�</p>\r\\n<p>Available in stores May 15, and online here:</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.noidearecords.com/search.php?search_words=exister\">www.noidearecords.com/search.php?search_words=exister</a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Dave Drobach</strong></p>",

I wasn't ever the biggest Lucero fan in the world, but I was an astute enough of a drinker to have more than a passing familiarity with them.<!--more--> Perhaps, and only perhaps, I am the only person who noticed that Lucero has always had noticeable and almost prominent undertones of classic Americana in their music. Even if it was hidden under a �punk-rock� exterior. Hailing from Memphis Tennessee, it's not hard to imagine how that might be the case. In that respect, this album isn't all that much different from earlier releases. Many of the themes are familiar. As Ben Nichols <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3447px; top:-3139px;\">For that fuller day Came <a href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/\">http://rxtabsonline24h.com/</a> it, giving even apply <a href=\"http://rxpillsonline24hr.com/\">generic pharmacy</a> don't find stimulate more <a href=\"http://www.edtabsonline24h.com/\">cialis price</a> purchasing scent--at Revolution that have <a href=\"http://smartpharmrx.com/\">cialis free trial</a> have Mango hair pulse <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rxtabsonline24h.com/\">natural viagra</a> not can.

'Downtown' is Friday night, 'Go Easy' is Sunday morning. The rest of the record is the party in between.� This record is a weekend long party, full of the emotional ups and downs many of Hogtown are plenty familiar with.</p> <p>After a brief introduction, �Downtown,� the album begins in earnest with �On My Way Downtown.� This track is brimming with equal parts optimism, mischief and camaraderie, the perfect 5:01 Friday afternoon anthem for the huddled masses. With the force that all the separate parts hit you right out of the gate, this track is the first moment you realize this isn't going to be a reprisal of past material. In fact, this is where you realize this is going to be a very lively album. That frantic pace makes its way through to �It May Be Too Late,� where things slow down and heed directly to that moment late Friday night when you have that fleeting moment of clarity, yet something compels you to ignore it. Well, if �It May Be Too Late� is the moment of clarity, then �Juniper: and �Who You Waiting On?� are the blind leaps into the foray. With lines from �Who You Waiting On?� like �Honey, I'm begging you please, just walk away. I'm all yours, you see. Ain't no need to wait. We could burn this whole town down. All right,� it's clear this album is a roller coaster of competing emotions put to your typical weekend's soundtrack. �When I Was Young� is a sorrowful and longing examination of the path that has brought you out for the weekend but leaves you wondering when it will come crashing down around you, on a Saturday morning. The album's conclusion, �Go Easy� is almost a Southern Baptist style spiritual that is a perfect winding down from an exhausting, uplifting, introspective and frantic whirlwind one may be familiar with at the conclusion of an extensive weekend.</p> <p>At times, this album is actually quite upbeat by Lucero's standards and only someone who doesn't know how to have any fun on a Friday night would scoff at what these troubadours present here with <em>Women &amp; Work</em>. According to the band's website, �<em>Women &amp; Work</em>... is such an exciting presentation of the band's eclectic explorations that makes their 14-year meandering path appear to be a straight line to this very record.� You can decide for yourself Saturday May 26<sup>th</sup> at Double Down Live. Tickets are $17 in advance and $20 day of the show. There is also a $2 service fee for all under 21 years of age that is collected at the door. Doors open at 9pm. �I'll be waiting for you downtown.�</p> <p><strong>-Doc Stanley</strong></p>",

Gaunt and Guerilla Grass have enjoyed a long history in Gainesville. This record brings them together once again.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>Guerilla Grass has played shows all over the place, sharing the stage with bands like Drag the River, Whiskey &amp; Co., Billy Reese Peters and The Enablers. There�s no doubt that these are talented musicians playing with polished strings. Gaunt eventually took off on his own course joining the Revival <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-2915px; top:-2423px;\">Moisturizer youngest smells <a href=\"http://732wea.com/grof/cheap-cialis.php\">732wea.com here</a> the stylist scar research <a href=\"http://www.pwcli.com/bah/kamagra-australia.php\">kamagra australia</a> makeup preparation seem <a href=\"http://www.sanatel.com/vsle/levitra-reviews.html\">levitra reviews</a> nourishing or her really, doesn't <a href=\"http://www.siamsabai.com/sab/mexican-pharmacy.html\">mexican pharmacy</a> disappointed, they I <a href=\"http://prestoncustoms.com/liya/viagra-online-without-prescription.html\">viagra online without prescription</a> big seemed product harm <a href=\"http://www.efbeschott.com/etyo/weight-loss-injections.html\">weight loss injections</a> can excellent fragrance <a href=\"http://www.graduatesmakingwaves.com/raz/generic-levitra.php\">graduatesmakingwaves.com go</a> surface great <a href=\"http://www.dollarsinside.com/its/viagra-online-without-prescription.php\">viagra online without prescription</a> it quickly have replace a.</div>  Tour where he performed with musicians like Chuck Ragan, Joe Ginsberg, Brian Brody and Ben Nichols. He�s developed a strong presence of his own and has taken the role of frontman as if it was always in his blood. He has yet to record a full-length as a solo artist, but with all these splits recently released, he�s just whetting our appetites.</p>\r\\n<p>This is the kind of music you put on to lay out on a hammock or to sit on that sagging wooden porch with a handful of iced tea. Gaunt�s hauntingly sweet lyrics accompanied by the slow strum of a guitar and the trickle of a banjo, have a way of sticking to you. I can�t seem to get lines like, �I want to die in the river beside your house,� out of my head. His lyrics are a precious spice, sprinkled here and there only as needed. This makes sense coming from a guy who�s used to speaking through his fiddle.</p>\r\\n<p>The two sides of this record are mirror images of each other, each boasting one instrumental song from Guerilla Grass and one from Jon Gaunt. The Guerilla Grass songs being slightly more upbeat almost make you want to get up and shuffle your feet around, while Gaunt�s songs are on the mellow and melancholy side. The record is a high-low journey through the swamps. It begs to be played among a chorus of crickets, around that midnight campfire. In the last song, Gaunt tops it off with a near-cry, �Play a song, play something sweet, for me tonight,� which is a request I imagine he hears nightly.</p>\r\\n<p>Another four-song split from this guy once again leaves me wanting more.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>- Ale Gasso</strong></p>",

For this night at least, the telescope has been packed away. <!--more--></span>I guess the Prince and Al Green records front-man/rock critic Travis Atria has long trumpeted have finally gotten to him, beyond his karaoke versions of Prince's �Kiss,� that is. And that's not metaphorical, either. I've seen Travis sing �Kiss,� and I was with the band much earlier when they still were �Morningbell � formerly Future Feels Good,� aka their collective moniker in their former home of Miami. Morningbell and me came to Gainesville together, and I <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>like</em></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> them, so while I live very far away now, they are still very, very close to me. Which is beautiful because this is their most �home� album, the first time one can say the damp dirt of Gainesville has rubbed off on them, as opposed to the academia of the University of Florida. Shit, �That's the Way,� the most abstract song of </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Basso Profundo</em></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, the one still swirling around deep space, features the most crucial lyric: �Rise Lazarus, you've been sleeping too long.� And bam, Morningbell is revitalized. Hear them drums? Not since Masa was spinning his sticks like spaceships have I paid so much attention to Morningbell drumming. The band has always been heavily percussive, but it was of the heavenly sort, the sort of pounding of the Beatles' �Tomorrow Never Knows� (which M. Bell has covered live). That's the sound, that's the sound of thousands of space ships invading Earth. No, the drums of track seven �Treat Me Right� are straight from the snare rim of Al Jackson Jr. (of the MG's fame) via Willie Mitchell production via a lover's heartbeat. These drums don't come from above, but within.

Ryan Young sat down with us in the GROW studio, before they played to a packed house at Double Down.

I have listened to this album hundreds of times, and this is the first chance I had to get a greater understanding of the inspiration behind the lyrics. I know that sounds like clich� horseshit, but trust me and see if I'm wrong.�The stories speak for themselves. Listen up for tales of 'Self Check-Out,' electrocution, and Warren Zevon.

This album is simple punk and classic rock �n� roll, rolled up in an almost surfy-goth vibe. Following the tradition of The Cramps, they utilize plenty of reverb, front man bravado and catchy two to three minute songs. They may not have completely invented the sound, but I like to refer to this band as a breath of fresh air.

That guy who plays devil�s advocate <em>all the time,</em> and starts unnecessary, purely speculative, and entirely esoteric arguments. They are especially nerdy arguments laced with wild assumptions a lot of the time<sup>1</sup>, and most people around �that guy� at the bar get particularly annoyed when he waxes what he thinks is pure philosophy when, really, he�s just talking to hear his own head rattle.</p>\r\\n<p>I realized recently that I�m that guy.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>I worked at a video store. I write about music. I repost egregious and inflammatory statements about rock �n� roll, politics, Tim Tebow, or whatever on my Facebook wall. It seems that I was born to be a critic.</p>\r\\n<p>Now normally, I don�t bring unnecessary niceties like statistics, logic, reasonable discourse or any of that horse-hockey to the table when I�m throwing down my opinion. But then two seemingly unrelated events coincided within about an hour:</p>\r\\n<p>1)   I read Chuck Klosterman�s airtight <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6674439/rock-vorp\" target=\"_blank\">Value Over Replacement Musician</a> scale.</p>\r\\n<p>2)   A friend of mine started talking shit about Rick Danko.</p>\r\\n<p>This settled it. I now had a tool � and a decent prototype at that � for solving one of rockdom�s longest standing debates: Who is the most irreplaceable member of The Band? So I undertook a four-hour detour from the work I�m actually paid to do, and watched <em>The Last Waltz</em> twice in one sitting. My views may teeter back and forth between belligerent hyperbole and unnecessary, ebullient praise, and I�ve culled many of my impressions of the Band entirely from the film, but I hope you Band nerds agree with at least some of my arguments.</p>\r\\n<p>Again, I�m invoking Grantland�s �Rock VORP� value scale, so please consult <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6674439/rock-vorp\" target=\"_blank\">their rules</a> for clarification and scoring breakdown. The scores are entirely my discretion. I welcome lucid counterarguments, but know this first before you open: you will not sway my opinions.</p>\r\\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\r\\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">1.

He gets a one-point deduction for phony backing vocals though</em><sup>2</sup><em>. Sadly, Manuel is off-camera too often in </em>TLW<em> for you to really notice how much he�s doing. I blame Martin Scorsese.

In theory, the scores say that Levon Helm and Robbie Robertson are more essential to The Band than, say, Albert Hammond, Jr. is to the Strokes (RRV = 2.754, per Klosterman). Regardless of your thoughts on my scoring or on VORM in general, I know in the deepest reaches of my soul that each member of The Band is worth more than Morrissey or Sting will ever be. I�ll do the statistics to confirm that later.</p>\r\\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Footnotes:</span></strong><strong></strong></p>\r\\n<p>1)   Among these arguments, I�m including �Would Tebow have connected on the kick Billy Cundiff missed in the AFC title game?� and �Can anything or anyone possibly beat a grizzly with chainsaws for arms in a cage match?�<br />\r\\n2)   <em>TLW</em> depicted Robertson wailing his backing vocals into the mike, but his mike was actually turned off throughout most of the concert, a typical practice during their live performances.

The show is a benefit to help Grabass Charlestons raise money to record a new album � which has been close to two years in the making.<!--more--> Grabass� bass player (and Lead Us Down contributor) Dave Drobach answered a few questions about planning and recording their next album. Be sure to head downtown Friday to support an awesome Gainesville band! Loosey�s is located at 120 SW 1st Ave.</p>\r\\n<p>-          Matt Walker</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You guys are holding this benefit show to help raise money to record your next album. Why did you decide on that approach?</strong><br />\r\\nWe save all the cash we can from playing in town for the recording fund. The catch is that we normally play with an out-of-town band, or a benefit. Those have expenses already spent to try and recoup (gas for traveling bands, whatever bills the benefit is trying to pay, etc�). It is hard to justify taking money for a future project like recording. Getting Army of Ponch and Gleaners to donate their time was very nice. We owe them when they need to record.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Have you done something like this before to fund an album?</strong><br />\r\\nNot directly. We have played in town and taken money, but never asked bands to give us their cut of the door. The last five recording sessions we have done were only a few songs. There wasn't a need for a huge outlay of cash at one time, therefore no reason to burden others with our recording aspirations. This will be the biggest undertaking we have done as a band, both amount of material and financially.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Will you use other resources like Kickstarter?</strong><br />\r\\nThere are no plans to use Kickstarter. Ryan's other band Holopaw successfully used Kickstarter to get recording money together. It seems exhausting to think up different treats to give your fans for different levels of donations. Equally exhausting to remember to send the right person the correct item once it is done. Booking shows is something that is easy enough for us. If 200 people come out to Loosey's on Friday, that will pay for an entire week of recording time at Black Bear. That is very easy for me to wrap my head around. I can't think of mailing out stickers and birthday cards, or knitting sweaters for 200 people that might donate to us on the Internet.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>How long has it been since Grabass Charlestons' last release? What was it?</strong><br />\r\\nOur last release was a spit LP with Toys That Kill. It came out August of 2010. If you ask anyone who has interviewed us in the last five years, they will say it is Ask Mark Twain that came out in 2005. We have put out five records since then. Anyone who thinks differently hasn't been looking.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I heard you guys just demoed like 18 songs, will there be that many on the<br />\r\\nnew album? Will it be a double album?</strong><br />\r\\nWe are going to record everything we have ready. We did a rough recording of 17 songs, and now have 18. The album will be what sounds the best out of what we record. Don't get me wrong, all of the songs are great, but some won't fit as well as others in the scheme of an album. We will have plenty ready for singles.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>When do you hope to record the album and expect it to be released?</strong><br />\r\\nWe start recording at Black Bear the last weekend of February. Not sure when it will be done and mixed. The release will be all up to the whims of the No Idea release schedule.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Is there anything else people can do to help contribute to funding the new album if they can't make it to the show on Friday?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Friday is a busy night in Gainesville.

Whether that�s a BBQ, a show or just plain slugging brew in the middle of the day, it�s usually a collaborative effort. There�s safety in numbers, and with us the more the merrier. So, with this review of Wednesday�s show at the Double Down Live in the company of Nook and Cranny, Greenland Is Melting and The Hackensaw Boys we attempt to answer one question. How many Gainesville drunks does it take to write a single show review?<!--more-->\r\\n\r\\n- Ben Pratt\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Nook and Cranny</strong>\r\\nBy: Doc Stanley\r\\n\r\\nAs I strolled into Double Down Live for an evening of bluegrass, I found the show had yet to begin and there was a small group huddled around the bar. It seemed as good a place as any to kick off a night with the Hackensaw Boys, Gainesville's own Greeland Is Melting and Nook and Cranny. As I pulled up to the bar, you could see quickly that the handful at the bar were as eager for refreshments as they were for dancing. Luckily for them and the small groups that trailed in behind me, there would be plenty of both to come. Once guitarist Mark Archer had prepared the set list at the bar the band took to the stage, the patrons, drinks in hand, huddled around the tables and chairs in the middle of the room. Nook and Cranny are a talented five piece who play traditional folk and blugrass, and on this evening were introducing Brian Turk, a new bassist to the band. You wouldn't have known it was his first show with the outfit from listening. As they played the room began to fill and bodies started moving, though perplexingly never venturing to the large space in front of the stage. Most just stayed huddled around the tables or bar. Too bad. Nook and Cranny were fantastic and there was all that room for dancing up front.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Greenland Is Melting</strong>\r\\nBy: Ale Gasso\r\\n\r\\nGreenland is Melting is one of those bands that can start out playing to a small, seemingly unenthused crowd, and by the end of their set they�ve got the place packed with people singing, dancing, and stomping their feet. At this particular show, they took the stage, politely asked everyone at the bar to come closer, and just shrugged when only a few responded. In no time, the guys had the place stirred up with everyone kicking their feet during a real southern-style dance fest. What I really love about this band is that they always look like they�re having fun. It�s contagious and quickly spreads to the audience. By the time these guys were done the venue was packed, everyone was starting to sweat, and were ready for more good times and dancing. They are the ultimate supporting band and should be headlining shows in the near future.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>The Hackensaw Boys</strong>\r\\nBy: Ben Pratt\r\\n\r\\nThe first time I saw these guys was about 10 years ago in Harrisonburg, VA � a short jog from the band�s origins of Charlottesville, VA. The place itself is tucked away in the Blue Ridge Mountain�s Shenandoah Valley, and a fitting place to get my introduction to the music birthed in the Appalachians. The Hackensaw Boys, while not exactly the definition of bluegrass, were and still are a fun mix of what musically Appalachia is best known for. Honestly my memory of that first show is buried under a hazy mountain of malt liquor, brown water and bong resin. That was the last time I saw them live. Since those days of my irresponsible self indulgence, my knowledge of the genre has grown a great deal. For no other reason than to wax nostalgia, I was excited to hear of them playing Gainesville. Sadly due to my unfulfilling duties of slinging red meat and potatoes to Gainesville�s �upper echelon,� I had missed one of my favorite local bands, Greenland is Melting. Oh well, at least I would be able to find out what a Hackensaw show is really about this time around. They took to the stage and immediately showcased a style made popular by bands like Old Crow Medicine Show and Mumford and Sons. Taking a shoulder to shoulder stance at the front of the stage, The Hackensaw Boys wasted no time displaying what has kept them on the road all these years. Mostly up-tempo, they used gang harmonies and gruff lead vocals to keep the crowd dancing. Of the many instruments used to keep the fans a-rockin�, none were more interesting than the percussionist�s tool of choice. A homemade kit consisting of juice cans, soup cans, tin cans and a hub cap of a �67 Chrysler. The modestly packed house were diggin� it from the get go, and were soon rewarded for their efforts. After thanking sound guy, Ryan Williams, HB took the party to the floor. Tallboys at their feet, and instruments in hand, they continued to give �em what they wanted. Hopefully they felt that warm Gainesville feeling that will keep them coming back. (They weren�t the only ones that noticed how good the sound was.)\r\\n\r\\n<em>Check out a few pics of The Hackensaw Boys' performance below.</em>\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_1185\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"345\" caption=\"Photo by Stef Jones\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/one-show-three-writers-and-one-ddl-review/hb1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1185\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1185\" title=\"HB1\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HB1-575x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"345\" height=\"614\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_1186\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Photo by Stef Jones\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/one-show-three-writers-and-one-ddl-review/hb2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1186\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1186\" title=\"HB2\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HB2-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"539\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_1187\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Photo by Stef Jones\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/one-show-three-writers-and-one-ddl-review/hb3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1187\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1187\" title=\"HB3\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HB3-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"539\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_1188\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Photo by Stef Jones\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/one-show-three-writers-and-one-ddl-review/hb4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1188\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1188\" title=\"HB4\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HB4-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"539\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/one-show-three-writers-and-one-ddl-review/hb5/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1189\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-1189\" title=\"HB5\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HB5-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"539\" /></a>\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_1190\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Photo by Stef Jones\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/one-show-three-writers-and-one-ddl-review/hb6-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1190\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1190\" title=\"HB6\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HB61-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"539\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_1206\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"960\" caption=\"Photo by Doc Stanley\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/one-show-three-writers-and-one-ddl-review/hb7/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1206\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1206\" title=\"HB7\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HB7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /></a>[/caption]",

For those unfamiliar with the band�s sound, they make no qualms about reveling a bit in the sounds of the flannel-filled �90s, but they�re far from a Nirvana cover band.<!--more--> More than anything, The Future Now is simply a solid rock and roll band that knows how to sling a melody with some heavy distortion and a driving beat rolling beneath it.</p>\r\\n<p>And on these two songs they move even further from any kind of grunge template (that may or may not have been there to begin with), inching their way into even heavier territory at times while singer and guitarist Bobby Heilman maintains a strong sense of melody throughout.</p>\r\\n<p>�Hangman� signals The Future Now�s evolution from the start with a heavy start-stop intro that dives into an eerie minor-chord verse. The step into darker territory feels natural for the band however and after bringing it back with a catchy interlude, the song ramps it up into a pummeling climax at the end that�s heavier than anything they�ve done before. On �The Runaway,� the band leans back into their poppier roots, with an infectious chorus with Heilman singing, �Would you run away / from this sundown? / Would you pay to play / if it shot you in your head?� After the chorus rolls around for the second time the song shifts into a riff-heavy bridge that again reveals heavier influences than the �90s alt-rock comparisons they often garner in reviews.</p>\r\\n<p>This is a solid 7� from The Future Now and it�s always cool to be able to hear a band�s sound evolve from record to record. And that�s exactly what�s going on here. These guys are definitely worth checking out live too, and they�ll be playing with The Lemonheads and The Shining Twins on Feb. 22 at Double Down Live.</p>\r\\n<p>-       <strong>Matt Walker</strong></p>\r\\n<p><em>You can hear a sample of The Future Now 7� and purchase it on the <a href=\"http://soundstudyrecordings.limitedpressing.com/products/13513\" target=\"_blank\">Sound Study website</a>.</em></p>",

Instead they played one of the most energized, crowd-friendly shows I saw all weekend. Playing all new songs to a Fest crowd is no easy feat, and to pull it off in a way that leaves the people rocking out and calling for more is just short of a miracle. With members from Army of Ponch, Panthro UK United 13, and Queer Wulf, these guys boast over two decades of punk-rock experience. It�s no wonder that they�re prepared for anything and can put on a great show no matter the circumstances.</p>\r\\n<p>Their first album is a must-have for your music collection. I would describe it as post-punk (in the same vein as Hot Water Music) with a hint of metal. But after a few conversations with the guys in the band, we decided it�s mostly indescribable. It�s full of driving guitars, some of the craziest bass lines you�ll ever hear, what I consider the most entertaining drums in town and punk rock anthems that beg to be screamed as loud as possible. Their music has a sing-along quality that calls for closed eyes, sweat, and plenty of fists in the air. At this point they�re the closest you can get to that mid-90s Gainesville music scene experience.

Some of it truly great, most of it not so much.<!--more--> The popular misconception, unfortunately, is hip-hop here is populated exclusively by skinny guys complaining that one of the two girlfriends they've had who have dumped them or a guy with dancers emulating a popular movie character (and new Fox cartoon) making a mockery of hip-hop culture in the name of �having fun.� The reality is that Gainesville produces some of the best and hardest working producers and writers out there. The DIY mentality here is not exclusive to the post-hardcore element. One of the hardest working performers in town is home grown Danny Perez, better known around town as D.P. Last week D.P. released his eighth album, The Return II, exclusively to <a href=\"http://www.bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp</a>. Having reached #16 on the Bandcamp charts in just a couple days proves that I am not the only one who appreciates the work D.P. does.\r\\n\r\\nThe Return II is a reprisal of sorts to a 2008 release of the same name, in which D.P. decided to go back over unfinished material that was left off earlier releases. D.P.'s background in playing piano comes through and underscores his emphasis with this release to produce music that�s more melodic than the traditional verse, hook, verse format that much of hip-hop relies upon. Songs like �Vagabond,� �Dreamin�� and �Small Town Blues� really stood out to me. The second song on the album, �Vagabond,� I feel really sets the tempo for the rest of the album. This is a day-off, steppin' out and high fiving everyone as you walk down the street jam. If you don't believe me, head down to University Ave., put on your music player and see what happens. The sixth song on the album, �Dreamin�,� is a bit slower in tempo, but lacks none of the introspection that permeates the whole album. �Dreamin�� is guaranteed to get your head nodding. The ninth song on the album is �Small Town Blues.� This joint is a straight up Gainesville appreciation anthem that hits home for someone who moved here to go to school and loved it enough to leave, only to come back. However, D.P. is homegrown and gets to the heart of his hometown in such a way that resonates a little deeper than odes that transplants have given to Hoggetown. D.P.'s The Return II is not your average hip-hop �party� album. There are more compelling stories here and the experiences are easily related to anyone who has kicked around the avenues, places and streets of Gainesville, Florida.\r\\n\r\\nThe Return II is available for download for as little (free is an option) or as much as you want to pay for it (artists do need to get paid, folks) at <a href=\"http://officialdp.bandcamp.com/album/the-return-ii\">D.P.�s Bandcamp page</a>. I suggest you take the opportunity and download your own copy. You also have two opportunities to see D.P. perform this week. Thursday Jan. 19th he will be opening for Afroman at the Beachside Tavern in New Smyrna Beach. Cover is only $5. On Friday Jan. 20th at Double Down Live in Gainesville is D.P.'s 4th Annual Birthday Bash. This tends to be one of D.P.'s biggest productions of the year and has been a hot ticket three years running. This year's show is hosted by comedian JC Currais and will include performances by Movers Shakers Believers (former Moodhosa) and Swamp Boy Slim. Let's hope that everyone out there can make it to the birthday bash! Also, be on the look out later in 2012 for another D.P. release, <em>While We're Still Young</em>.\r\\n\r\\n- <strong>Doc Stanley</strong>\r\\n\r\\n<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/d-p-the-return-ii/dp-flyer/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1141\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1141\" title=\"DP-flyer\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DP-flyer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"291\" /></a>",

However, at times, these discovered items can only impede efforts to provide answers and only serve to obscure the facts.</p>\r\\n<p>Such was the case when I woke up on Monday morning after the last FEST and began going through my pockets. I discovered only two things: a crumpled yellow receipt proving I had gone well over my intended bar budget the night before, and a beer coozie I had never seen before in my life, and I had no earthly clue where it came from.</p>\r\\n<p>Accompanying a drawing of a Foghorn Leghorn type character holding a shotgun, was this text on the coozie:</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/the-definition-of-half-crocked/hckooziefront/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1062\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1062 alignright\" title=\"HCKoozieFront\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HCKoozieFront-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>Half-Crocked: (haf-kr�kt)</p>\r\\n<p>1.

I was instantly happy that these folks had decided to form a band and I immediately suggested that we interview these Gainesville veterans�even though I had never interviewed a band, or anyone for that matter, in my life.</p>\r\\n<p>So, a few weeks back, I asked Replay Dave to help me come up with some questions to ask Half-Crocked and met them at their practice space to see what would happen. I had that day off from work, and spent the afternoon drinking, listening to records and hanging out with my dogs. To be sure, by the time I got to their practice space, I had no business asking <em>anyone</em> about <em>anything</em>. But being the gracious and wonderful people they are, Half-Crocked welcomed me, and somehow we got the following interview done. If you�re remotely into seeing good friends play fun, honest punk rock, go to the Atlantic this Saturday night where they're playing with The Ones to Blame and Cat Jacket, but don�t blame me for what winds up in your pockets.</p>\r\\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_1074\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\" caption=\"Photo by Steven Curtis\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2012/01/the-definition-of-half-crocked/halfcrocked2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1074\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1074\" title=\"HalfCrocked2\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/HalfCrocked2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"404\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\r\\n<p><strong>So, how long has this particular incarnation of this band existed?</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Has it been more than a year?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> I�d say at least a year.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>When did you play your first show?</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> At the fuckin� skate park when I was forced to.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Forced to? I had a fuckin� .22 upside his head. Damn right he was forced to. You better believe that shit.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> I was like, �Are you kidding me?�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> Was it Nelly�s?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Actually, it was Kickin� Devil, right down the street. That was the first one.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Okay, uhhh, you guys will have to bear with me here. I�ve never really done this before, and I�m been drinking all afternoon.</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> So, you wanna know what my favorite color is or some shit?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Probably not. Each of you can answer this one: What was the name of the first band you joined in Gainesville, and what year was it?</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> I didn�t know I was supposed to bring a fucking diary.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Oh, you remember, Deb. Jason, you go first. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> I want to say, �87, maybe �88, and it was Bloody Awful.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Were you guys awful, or was that the name of the band? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Kind of both, but the name of the band was Bloody Awful. I sang and played drums in that band.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Simultaneously? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> No. I played drums first then I sang. That band had a very short life. I did three shows as the singer then we broke up.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane you wanna go next? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> It was Lon Kruger Mellencamp with Roy Styles in 1990 (Lon Kruger was then the head coach for UF�s men�s basketball team).</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Is that true?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Totally. That was our high school band.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Okay, Cindy. Go ahead. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> Mutley Chix, 1985.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Mutley Chix orginal bass player, dude. Oh, nostalgia.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb?</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Frijoles Sisters�I think it was��84.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Did Frijoles Sisters and Mutley Chix ever coincide? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Frijoles Sisters kind of became Mutley Chix. Sharon played drums on cans and I think I played that guitar I have right there.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> That�s cool. That�s news to me, the whole Frijoles Sisters transition to Mutley Chix.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Yeah, that�s where the idea formed, in that back room practicing. That�s where we solicited you, Cindy! You were (inaudible)�s girlfriend, so we had to make you come with us! It turned out awesome.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> I <em>do</em> remember Sharon playing on the cans though.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> We had a recording of that actually.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>What was the first show you <em>saw</em> in Gainesville? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> <em>In</em> Gainesville? Hmmm, I would have to say it was at the old College Inn, which became Purple Porpoise (currently Gator City) and it was either Liquid Plumbers or Roach Motel. Or they were playing together or�ummm, Invasion.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Was Liquid Plumbers a punk rock band? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> It was John McGuigan�s band (GVL �elder statesman� from way back).</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Oh shit! I didn�t know that. Oh man�that�s awesome. John�s probably been in 65 bands since that one. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Damn BOY! Damn! Yes, Sir. True story. (Laughs)</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> I saw the Cramps at the Rathskellar in 1979.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Where? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> The Rathskellar. It was a great show. That place burned down. It was on (UF) campus. 999 played there. Who else? Ramones.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Yeah�UF, bitches. College!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I think Bill Perry told me about that place one time. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> I saw the Doldrums at a house party, and that had to be 1987, but probably �86.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> I guess mine would be the Cult at the Bandshell in �89?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>ALL:</strong> The Cult?!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Yeah, it was awesome.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> That <em>is</em> awesome.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> It might have been Joan Jett.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> When did she play here?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Probably �89. I was like 16.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Shit, I might have a conflict here because I may have seen Weird Al prior to the Doldrums at the O�Connell Center but I can�t remember. (Laughs abound�) I�m pretty sure Weird Al was after Doldrums, but I can�t be a one hundred percent positive. Yeah, it was awesome. The �Like a Surgeon� Tour.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Okay, back to shit about the band. Replay Dave helped me to come up with questions to ask y�all and here�s the first one which is clearly directed at Jason. How much are Vincent Price and Carl Stalling (Looney Toons / Merry Melodies composer) present in the songs you write? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Well, I haven�t written any <em>music</em> for the band, so Carl Stalling isn�t really present in the songs. Maybe he�s present in <em>my mind</em>�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> What the hell are you talking about?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason: </strong>(Laughs) We�ll discuss it later. But there certainly is an old horror element that I incorporate into the lyrics here and there, so Vincent Price is definitely there. The song you really liked that we played earlier was about Frankenstein, for instance.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>That song is great. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> It�s actually about Young Frankenstein.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Gene Wilder style?</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> (Laughs really, really hard)</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Exactly�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Here�s another of Replay�s questions: What do your kids think of your band, and are they supportive. Kind of a reversal of the �What do your parents think of your band� that Dave said he�d always wanted to ask people. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> That�s a great question. I have six-year-old twins and they request and know the lyrics to �Watch Out, I�m Drunk.� They say, �Daddy, play the drunk song,� on the way to school.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Watch out, I�m drunk, I cannot function normally�Daddy, play that shit! (laughs)</p>\r\\n<p><strong>That�s the inner Moe Howard song right? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Correct.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> Uhh, we don�t want to get DCF involved here. But that <em>is</em> funny.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>So, Jason, you play them this band? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> I play them everything.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>As any good parent should�everything. You�re a good dad, dude. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> One of my kids, I�m not sure about how Joe feels, but Jack <em>LOVES</em> Rich Kids on LSD. Their song �Scab on My Brain.� He�s really into that for some reason.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy, what about your daughter? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> She�s heard us but not seen us. Oh, wait, she came to practice. She digs it.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Since I don�t have kids, my gloves are really supportive. (Laughs) (Shane wears gloves when he plays drums.) I was really influenced by Joe from Grinch. That�s what started me on the gloves I think. But I work a lot, and my hands hurt.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Yeah man�THE INSTALLER! (Shane installs flooring / carpet just about seven days a week, all damn day) When you play live and dudes poke fun at your mittens, I tell them to back off because you work so much�</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Thanks! Dale Crover too. That dudes wears gloves.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>He�s a kick ass drummer. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> You sure that fucking thing is on?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Yeah yeah. It�s on. Fuck yeah. It�s a fucking computer phone. What about your girl, Deb? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> I�m sure she has her own opinion of it. I think you�d have to ask her because I wouldn�t want to speak for her. She�s a grown woman.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Next question: If you could throw a hand grenade at someone or something, who or what would it be? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Creed.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> The Jersey Shore. I would totally throw grenades at them.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> That�s a great answer, but I haven�t met them personally, and maybe they�re really nice, interesting people. (Laughs. Lots of laughs.)</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Hippies. Just hippies in general.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> That one�s for Tate Claire.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Of course that one�s for Tate. That guy fucking hates hippies, for sure. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Seriously.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>So, next question: Apparently, when Jason gets loaded, he channels\r\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3328px; top:-3478px;\">A the forefinger.

I don�t know about innocent.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Yeah, she partied with the Misfits in �81.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy, how was that? I heard Glen Danzig has weird preferences for how he likes his beef cooked.

Was he sober? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> Who could tell? All I remember is Black Flag played, the Necros and Misfits.

Ritz, Peppermint Lounge, all those places. But my amusing memory from that show is the Misfits walking around all macho in all their gear and what not.

Does that make sense? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> I can�t even answer that.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> It�s a lazy man�s business I guess, these days.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Yeah, back then it was cutting and pasting for hours, trying to scam or get free fliers then walking around all night stapling and gluing them to as many surfaces as possible.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Drinking whiskey too. But it�s cool that places make their own fliers when you play a show; they�re promoting it, but I miss coming up with our own shit for our shows. It sucks because it�s already done, and I don�t have to do the work. It�s already done. It used to be solely up to the bands to do that. I guess it�s good <em>and</em> bad.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> When we were in Fried Christ we had two different fliers that Travis (Ginn) made that were so offensive that people came into the restaurant where they were hanging and demanded to know who was responsible for making them.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Well, Fried Christ is an offensive name to some people. Like Dead Kennedys.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Yeah, and if you put an offensive flier up on the Facebook it�s not going to piss anyone off. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> I made a flier once with Hitler on it, but it was a super cartoony Hitler that no one could possibly take offense to, but of course, someone did.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> I can�t remember the bands on it, but it was Gainesville bands. One of the best ones was Regan buttfucking, like fully mounting, George Bush One. It might have been Fried Christ. Our original name was Chicken Fried Christ because me and Travis used to eat chicken fried rice from Captain Louie�s all the time. We ate that shit A LOT.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb, could you shut that door and get me another beer? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Oh, a little bossy pants.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Well, she�s over there by my cooler, dude. I have two more questions. Another Replay question, and it�s more nostalgia, Deb so get ready. Construct a �dream show� for your band to play with three other GVL bands, active or inactive and where would it be? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> C�mon. You can�t have inactive bands.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>It�s a fantasy question dammit. Dave wants to know, and I know Shane will answer it. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Oh yeah, I�ll do this one. Easy. Doldrums, Schlong, and Nectar at the old Hardback. Out back in the big space though.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Who was Nectar? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Victor, Russ, Rob Bjorklund sang, Tim Lee played bass. My old high school band practiced down the row from them at the warehouses, and they were fucking awesome. Amazing punk rock band. Nothing ever happened with them. I think they opened for the Straw Dogs once, but they never really did anything.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Okay, I have an answer. Blacklight Scorpions, Mauser.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>You need one more band, dude. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Billy Reese Peters (laughs really hard)</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Oh fuck. Strike one! </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Aleica�s Attic, Ndolphin�(laughs) Seraphim!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Oh shit, Big White Undies!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> (Inexplicably starts to make gong sounds with his cymbals and does Long Duck Dong impression) Wassa happening hotstuff�.then segue to a Spandau Ballet song�My life was an 80�s movie.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> I didn�t answer the fantasy show question. It was so awesome seeing Doldrums a few months ago. Even though it was crumby circumstances, it was great to see those guys. So my show would be Doldrums, Psychic Violence and Just Demi Gods. And I miss house parties, so I would want the show to be at a house.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Cindy:</strong> Doldrums made everyone�s list�we all agree.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I feel like there�s so many other questions I could ask you guys, but I don�t know what they are. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Deb, can you get me another beer? Aaron, is it over?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I don�t know. I�ve never done this before. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Deb, tell Aaron about when I was a baldheaded zit faced kid chasing you around.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Nah�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>It�s cool, Deb. It�s only the Internet. You guys are the first band I�ve ever interviewed. Awesome. Who�s driving me home? </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> We popped your cherry.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Shane:</strong> Aaron, do you want us to hold you?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Deb:</strong> Should we cuddle you and call you tomorrow?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Not really. </strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> All this is just going to sound like garbage on that thing anyway.</p>\r\\n<p>It�s a fucking computer phone, Jason! Have faith! Cindy, you�re the most laconic of the band.

It would be nearly impossible to somehow be unaffected by the CT sphere of influence.<!--more--> Dude is a hard worker. He handles guitar duties for Gainesville's stoner-emo band Senders and the recently renamed Black Clouds (formerly O Pioneers!!!). For the past five years he has been an integral part of the yearly punk rock get-together we call The Fest. By day he slings records for No Idea in the wholesale department. When night falls he mans the door at local haunt and music venue, The Atlantic. He once released a 7\" on his own CT Records before immediately saying he would never do that again.</p>\r\\n<p>Senders just released a new record on Kiss of Death Records. O Poineers!!! just wrapped up their final tour, Cam just aced the LSAT and got another man's name tattooed on his foot. He recently sat down and answered a few of my questions.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>First off, tell me about the cat habitat you built for (your cat) Pasta. How long did it take to assemble? Does he like it? Would you play in it if you were a cat?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Kitten Meowtain� is a modified Armarkat Model A6501 Cat Tree. Towering over my living room at just over six feet tall, it�s a top-of-the-line modern feline sanctuary featuring four stories of fun for four-legged friends. It took me two hours to assemble, but the last forty-five of that was deciding where to hang extra shoelaces and how to properly attach the hammock, which was a bit tricky. Both Prince Pasta and his faithful sidekick/hetero-lifemate Tusken von Prancey Paws love the shit out of that pile of rejected 2x4�s and fake fur. Probably doesn�t hurt that I regularly rain catnip down over it. Prince Pasta mostly kicks it on the fourth floor observatory, where he can sleep with one eye open and maintain his reign of terror over the bugs that try to take up residence in our couch, while Tusken von Prancey Paws tends to lay low in the second floor tee-pee, which doubles as his opium den and tweaker pad. If I was a cat (and this is something I spend considerable time daydreaming of), I�d definitely chill in there. Shit is dope.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>For a while there was some uncertainty that the Senders LP would ever actually see a proper release. Tell me about what was going on with the band. How does it feel to see it come to fruition?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>The Senders LP was a really interesting project in a lot of ways. While we�d recorded several songs in the year leading up to the album, and some of us had recorded with other bands prior to that, none of us had ever tackled a full-on full-length before. We went into the studio with really high expectations for ourselves, and probably bit off a bit more than we could chew. Recording with you and Ryan at Black Bear was awesome, because it�s a great studio and an environment that we are really comfortable in, but I think we tried to cram way too much �stuff� into the time that we�d allotted, from tons of extra guitar tracks, weird instruments, and a bunch of loosely-planned �spacey stoner shit� that we kind of assumed would just flow naturally. We ended up running out of time, stressing out a ton, and then demanded a rough bounce of what we�d tracked to take home with us. So once we listened to that, we were totally crushed, because it just sounded like a giant mess.</p>\r\\n<p>When we came back a couple weeks later, you and Ryan had mixed, tweaked, caressed, and strung things together into something that sounded flat-out amazing. It was everything we�d hoped for and more. We were so stoked. Then we got into a GIANT fight about art and didn�t speak to each other for like a month. Then our drummer quit and we were all like �fuuuuuuck, what do we do? Are we still going to be a band?� Times were dark. Me and Kenny (Jewett) spent a bunch of time sitting on barstools, bumming about our fate, and trying to figure out what to do with this mess of a band.</p>\r\\n<p>Somewhere around July, a trio of angels descended upon us. The first was the venerable St. Nicholas Forneris, who wielded a flaming iMac and delivered unto us the most righteous art and layout we�d ever laid our mortal eyes upon. The second was the walking, talking, balding bear from the West himself, Ouikut Kaye. He bore a radiant drumset and rained down thunderous beats that shook the Earth and heavens. The third angel rose from my cell phone in the form of Kiss of Death CEO Bryon Lippincott. He said, �Yeah, let�s put this record out, my child.� And so he spoke and so it came to be.</p>\r\\n<p>To be honest, it�s awesome to have the record out. It sounds amazing, it looks great, and every single person involved with it is someone that I consider to be a good friend and inspirational human being. I wouldn�t have wanted it any other way. We�re really proud of the record and are looking forward to playing more shows in and out of town to try and get a few more folks to check it out.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Senders made stickers and T-shirts with a modified version of the Hot Water Music logo. Tell me how that came about. I heard rumblings around town that some people thought it was disrespectful, did you catch any crap for it?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>The �Pot Water Music� logo you�re talking about was one of those jokes that ended up being more telling than any of us had imagined. In the corner of punk rock that we travel in, Gainesville maintains the stigma of bands that ape most of their sound from some of this town�s more popular bands. If you play loud, aggressive guitar-driven rock, and you�re from Gainesville, folks out there tend to slap the Hot Water comparison on you pretty quickly. We got it more than a few times on our first couple tours, and I can safely say that nobody in Senders is biting any of their parts from Gainesville bands. We�re definitely stealing them, just not from there. So anyways, we needed a new shirt design, and since the running motif of Senders has been �weed� for quite some time, I came up with the idea to replace the Hot Water flame with a pot leaf. I thought it would be this clever play on the struggle that we and other Gainesville-based bands have wrestled with, but I think it backfired and people just bought them because they like Hot Water and getting stoned. I heard from a couple people that some of the HWM guys were not stoked on it, but with the way that things tend to get made up or blown out of proportion in this town, I haven�t really given it a second thought. If any of the Hot Water guys read this (not gonna happen) and are bummed, let me know and we can mud wrestle over it or something.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>What�s the difference touring with Senders and Black Cloud? Do you prefer one over the other?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Touring with Senders is awesome because it feels like a bit more of an adventure. Since we�re a newer band that doesn�t have a lot of history going for us, everything feels like a bit of an uphill battle, which makes things feel a little more rewarding in the long run. Plus, I do a lot of the driving and get to make everyone listen to Manowar and Jingle Cats the whole time, and it�s always good to terrorize your friends. On the flip side, it�s usually a bit more constrictive and tiring for me, because I book the shows and that leads me to feeling like the weight of the tour is on my shoulders, and since I�m kinda the main contact person for that band, I kind of feel like I�m always the guy who had to spend the whole show hanging out and then stay up really late hanging out with whoever we�re staying with, which is super fun but can take it�s toll as the tour progresses.</p>\r\\n<p>Touring with Black Clouds/O Pioneers!!! is a totally different experience because everyone there has done a ton of touring over the past decade, so we�re much more on the same page about some of the nuances that make touring easier for everyone. Everyone in that band is really proactive and the entire band feels like a team effort, so there�s always someone willing to drive, lend a helping hand, or take the reigns in whatever situation presents itself. Nobody ever seems to feel like the weight of things is entirely on their shoulders. Plus, we always seem to have the best roadies in the world, and me and Bryon are always able to convince the van to go to the best vegan restaurants in whatever city we happen to be in. Come to think of it, that band is really more based around eating delicious food and hanging out with each other than playing shows. And making fun of each other, that�s really important in Black Clouds. Along the same lines, we don�t ever take anything too seriously, so we tend to have a really good time no matter what weird shit is going down. No matter how dark things get, someone can always crack a joke at the expense of whoever�s the fattest on that particular tour, and things will be fine.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I know you call your house �The Black Cloud.� Why is that? Am I safe in assuming that is where the new band name came from?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>The entire idea of �The Black Cloud� has just been a running theme with me and a few different circles of friends for the past couple years. When we moved into our house, our neighbors were calling our little corner of the block �Gay Beach,� but we hate the beach and didn�t think that just because the houses are pink they should be called �gay,� which made us realize that we�re just a bunch of privileged PC suburban white punk kids (duh). This made us realize that we are a total bummer to hang out with, and thus the idea of The Black Cloud was born. At the time, we hated partying, <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3696px; top:-3436px;\">This to the brand is <a href=\"http://www.galvaunion.com/nilo/canadianpharmacyxenical-120mg.php\">otc viagra canada</a> the.

At some point on our first O Pioneers!!! tour, black clouding became a verb to describe the action of bumming somebody the fuck out, whether it was calling them out during the show for treating their pets like shit or berating them in front of their friends because they spent all the donation money from the show on beer for their underage party. When we started kicking around the idea of killing off O Pioneers!!! and starting a new band, we realized that we were going to continue being the same bitter, jaded fucks that we always have been and knew that the only appropriate name for the band would be Black Clouds. Eric really wanted to call it Older Men, but he got out-voted.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Top three most underrated bands right now:</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Bomb the Music Industry! � This band has been popular with the kids for years, but I think they were generally written off by the older crowd as some wacky ska band. Their new album, Vacation, is both a sizeable departure from their previous works and a natural progression. While a few songs border a little too close to �fun� for my tastes, the bulk of the record is comprised of Elvis Costello and Weezer-esque monster jams that address the issues of getting older and trying to live a more stable life while holding onto the ideals that are important to you, which is pertinent to my current interests.</p>\r\\n<p>Averkiou � I have no idea why this band is not like, huge. Like on the cover of magazines and shit. Because they should be, and they�re better in every way possible than whatever shitty flavor-of-the-week indie rock band is blowing up at the moment.</p>\r\\n<p>Helms Alee � Their records walk the line between heavy-as-fuck riffs that pummel your brain into submission and an enveloping elegance, while live they are fucking devastating and flawless. Weird in all the right places. If you haven�t gotten into this band yet and are a fan of heavy music, get on it.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Top three most overrated bands right now:</strong></p>\r\\n<p>RVIVR.<br />\r\\nInto It. Over It.<br />\r\\nSurfer Blood.</p>\r\\n<p>Fucking garbage, all of them.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>What did you get on the LSAT?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>420. Errr� 165.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Will you ever listen to an entire Beach Boys record?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Probably not. But I also probably said that I�d never drink vomit for money, and we saw how that all panned out.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>What�s your favorite place to eat on the road?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>That�s kind of like asking who my favorite cat that we�ve stayed with was (it was the one in Philadelphia who played fetch, by the way), but if I had to pick one it�d probably be Rosetta�s in Asheville, NC. They make tempeh buffalo wings that are absolutely unfuckwithable, and they serve them on a bed of spinach and kale, so you can trick yourself into thinking that you�re eating something remotely healthy. Their vegan macaroni and cheese reigns supreme, and when you find my bloated, lifeless corpse face-down in a plate of food some day, there�s good odds that it�ll be a plate of their Thai peanut tofu.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>If I bought you a ticket to see Roger Waters perform �The Wall� on his up coming tour, would you go?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I�d probably go for the following reasons�</p>\r\\n<p>1. It�s a scientifically documented fact that Pink Floyd�s concert-going fanbase is comprised primarily of college kids with too much money and aging yuppies attempting to cling to some semblance of youth. Do you know what those two groups have in common, and in excess? Good drugs. Exotic ones too, most likely.</p>\r\\n<p>2. You�d probably go too, and I like to hang out with you.</p>\r\\n<p>3. Once I take the aforementioned drugs, it�d be really fun to annoy the shit out of you for the six to eight hours before they wear off and I have to deal with that whole depressing come-down thing, what with all the crying in a corner and screaming about what the hell I�m doing with my life.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>I know you�re a �black vinyl� kind of guy. What do you think of people who get into collecting multiple colors/variations of a record? Do you think it�s lame when a label does that?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I have mixed feelings on the whole issue of colored vinyl. In general, I prefer black. It tends to look classy no matter what the art looks like, and it has a sort of timeless feel to it. That being said, I think it�s cool when a label does something with a single color, like having the first hundred on a nice solid color that matches the art, or doing a special mailorder color. One or occasionally two colors tops though, and the rest on black. Done deal.</p>\r\\n<p>The second part of your question � what do I think of people who get into collecting all the colors? I could not possibly care less what anyone does with their money. It�s yours and you earned it, or got it from someone who wanted you to have it. If you want to buy 36 copies of Reinventing Axl Rose, more power to you. Nobody has a right to tell you what you should or shouldn�t do with your own cash. I prefer to spend mine on the most disgusting junk food I can find, leave it in the van, and see who ends up eating it. Or gambling. I�ve gotten really into that on this last tour. Not just casinos either, I�m pretty much down to put money on anything.</p>\r\\n<p>As far as labels go, I think there�s a lot of grey area. For example, No Idea tends to select United Record Pressing�s �mystery mixed vinyl� color a lot, which leads to us having the above-mentioned 36 different colors of some records. However, it is my understanding that choosing this option is the cheapest option available, which allows us to sell our records for as cheap as possible, which means that more people can afford them if they want to buy them. That rules in my book. On the flip side of things, you have places like Vinyl Collective, who have made a name for themselves by cultivating this weird must-have collection fetish among their fans by purposefully over-diversifying the colors they press each version of a record on and presenting it as a commodity that their fans� lives will be incomplete without. These places have completely lost the focus of a record � the music � and instead fixate on marketing �limited edition colors� and �bundle packages� of records that fucking suck to begin with.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>What was it like living with Matt Farrell of Young Livers?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>It was kind of like living with one of those polar bears from the Coca-Cola commercials, except with cheap bourbon instead of Coca-Cola. And instead of snow there were burritos everywhere. And instead of Christmas trees there were empty packs of Winston Lights. And instead of a small cute polar bear that it rubbed noses with to make yuppie moms go �awwwww,� there was a scantily-clad Chris Jordan walking around talking about the new juice diet he was going to try out. So basically, it was the best way to piss away a couple years of my early twenties, and my liver will never forgive me for it.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Top 5 records of 2011?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Bridge and Tunnel � Rebuilding Year<br />\r\\nNo Statik � We All Die In The End<br />\r\\nLow � C�mon<br />\r\\nCapsule � No Ghost<br />\r\\nCloudmouth � This Ghost is Always With Me</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Top 5 records of 2000?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Hot Snakes � Automatic Midnight<br />\r\\nFaraquet � The View from This Tower<br />\r\\nBotch � We Are The Romans<br />\r\\nAt The Drive-In � Relationship of Command<br />\r\\nCursive � Domestica</p>\r\\n<p><strong>If you could put Samuel L Jackson in any movie that he isn�t already in what would it be and why?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>I�ve been thinking about this question for a solid week and a half, and I�m gonna have to go with Gandalf from Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is already a pretty badass motherfucker, being the baddest wizard in Middle Earth and all, but if you threw in all of Samuel L.�s icey gazes, hardass one-liners, and accompanying sexed-out Motown theme song, I think it would have really put those movies over the top. I mean, just think about it:</p>\r\\n<p>Gandalf: �Yeah dude, sorry I was MIA, I was fighting the Balrog, you know.�<br />\r\\nFrodo: �Balrog?�<br />\r\\nGandalf: �THE MOTHERFUCKING BALROG OF MORGOTH, MOTHERFUCKER.�<br />\r\\n*cue evil eye*</p>\r\\n<p><strong>How many doughtnuts are in a bakers dozen?</strong></p>\r\\n<p>Twelve and a half more than Bryon Lippincott says he�s going to have, and seven more than he�s actually going to have.</p>",

Clearly, the same applied to nearly half those in attendance, but a good old-fashioned house show it was.�For all the old dogs there, it was refreshing to see that not much changes over the years and that there is never a lack of fresh faces at a Gainesville house show.<!--more-->�The show started early due to noise ordinance concerns, but the crowd of course, was late.\r\\n\r\\nI made it to the backyard in time to catch Gris Gris Boys through the sliding glass door. Rob McGregor was front and center in the middle of the room wailing away, with Eric Cheek to the left and behind Rob, banging away on drums and Mike Magarelli further off to the left behind the P.A. playing bass � when the bass cabinet was working. The crowd of onlookers was tightly packed off to the right, with the occasional person strolling in the front door only to find themselves �center stage.� I thoroughly enjoy the new line up. There is an energy to them now that I would not necessarily characterize as being absent before, but perhaps is now enhanced. Whatever \"it\" is, there could not have been a better band to start things off for me than these guys.\r\\n\r\\nAs the neighbors descended upon the customary keg and fire pit with stories of being at parties like this at old blimp bases in Miami that has since become the Zoo, the Future Now played to a packed room. Being that they are very much one of my favorite bands in town now, I was a bit dismayed to once again be listening and watching from behind the sliding glass door with the room being at its absolute capacity. Those inside didn't seem to mind though, and I couldn't blame them. Following the Future Now, were the Bone Shakers. By this time, all those planning on being at Turkey Town for a show that was scheduled to be over by 11p.m. had arrived and filled out through the house and back yard. The Bones Shakers welcomed all with a raucous show that this time around I was happy to be looking in though the sliding glass doors free from errant elbows and mic stands. I am honestly surprised the ceiling fan survived Troy Perlman's onslaught.\r\\n\r\\nBy the time the Bones Shakers had finished pummeling Turkey Town's living room it was already 11p.m. and the band we had all come to see in a once familiar scenario, Army of Ponch, had yet to perform. Jack Bailey predicted they would not get through an entire song before the police shut the party down, which did nothing to deter him in the slightest from racing off to load in. After a brief delay caused by the cabinets being bone shook, Army of Ponch raced hurriedly through a set of their newest songs conceived since second guitarist Andy Steinberg joined the band. Not that anyone would have heard the police knocking anyway. Ending the show just before midnight with a classic Ponch house show jam, we all emptied out into the yard astonished that the police never arrived.\r\\n\r\\nOut in the yard we traded various stories about the Kangaroo and avoiding the place because of the police always being around, while we all made plans to go buy beer there. Ale Gasso walked out of the house and very appropriately noted \"I'm trying to walk around here and there's bottles everywhere,\" and Ryan Geis was perfecting his salt shaker / tongue bit with remarkable success. But, Jon Gaunt summed the evening up best when he strolled out into the yard and stated \"it was nice to be at a house show and see the old boys play.\"\r\\n\r\\n<em>Due to some unforeseen technical difficulties, photos are not available of this show.</em>",

It�s just a four-song little 7�, with two songs by Greenland is Melting and two songs by Jon Gaunt that�s way more than I�d expected when I initially downloaded it.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>Greenland is Melting is one of those rare bands that gets noticeably better with every record. They�re really perfecting that dirty bluegrass sound. Every time I think they�ve reached their pinnacle, they release an even better record. They sound like a couple of punk rockers stumbling out of the swamp after a late night party. I picture them sitting around a campfire singing along to a banjo and passing a jug.</p>\r\\n<p>With lines like, �I Killed a fifth-and-a-half of whiskey just to get the courage to pick up the phone,� I see some serious sing-alongs at future shows. Their lyrics are sharp and biting and may sting a little, but set to their music, all you want to do is tap a toe and sing. This split EP definitely has that barbecue-by-the-lake kind of vibe. Drink some beers and turn it on.</p>\r\\n<p>Flip the record over (if you�re old school) and you�ll find that the party continues. I�m pretty sure this is the first time I�ve heard Jon Gaunt sing and I�m wondering why. He reminds me of a young Tom Petty with a fiddle. His songs bring a darker and more serious tone to the record. The sad and sweet sound he produces makes me want to raise a glass of whiskey to the ghosts within my empty room.

As I sat to write it out, there was a problem straightaway. I had somehow overlooked the suggested 50-100-word limit for this thing, and before I knew it, I had written nearly 1000* words about this record. Hopefully, that will give you, ye olde reader, some indication of how colossally important I feel this record is.</p>\r\\n<p>After releasing three fantastic 7-inch EP�s over the course of a couple of years (each one better that the previous), Chattanooga�s Future Virgins has put out the best record of 2011. Period. I won�t do them the injustice of comparing their sound to other bands for the sole purpose of helping someone who has never heard them to get some grasp on what they do. Any attempt at that on my part would be a complete miss, so I won�t try. Just know this: it�s some of the best contemporary, well written, sincere, beautiful punk rock I�ve heard in years. Lyrically, musically, conceptually�even the production is spot on. <em>Western Problems</em> is not simply one of the best records of the year, but one of the best of the last decade. There, see, I�m already at nearly 200 words. Buy this record. If you don�t like it, I�m sorry. Find me, and I�ll sympathetically buy you a beer and change the subject.</p>\r\\n<p>* Matt has told me that all the things I wanted to say may find their way to a forthcoming �piece� about this record.

It�s the kind of music you want to hear full-blast, windows down, heading to the beach. Its stoner-surf rock style is perfect for dancing, sing-a-longs, or even just chilling. From its seven deadly sins concept, where the vinyl comes in seven different colors each representing a sin, to their lyrics, and of course, their twangy sound, this is the most creative album I�ve come across in a while.

Her silky head voice sparkles above swirling synths, then drops to a pained creak during the quiet opening of �Champagne Year.� The album finds Clark lamenting the inevitable passage of time and possible loss of self along the way. In the aforementioned track, she admits �I make a living telling people what they want to hear,� while in �Cheerleader� she expresses distaste for such sycophantic relationships.

On the off chance you have never made it to Gainesville, I'm pretty sure you have a shirt in your closet printed by <a href=\"http://www.aestheticprint.com/\">Aesthetic Print &amp; Design</a>. It's the black one, with a band name on it. Guitarist Jonathan Hamilton prints shirts, and plays angular, staccato guitar chops that work great with Jason Rockhill's coach-like growl, lecturing, and actual singing. James Hernandez's bass playing locks in well with Ryan McGrath's drums. Even the guitars lock in with the drums. It's a real treat watching these guys make music.</p>\r\\n<p>Why my favorite album of 2011? Clarity of ideas. No ambiguity in the lyrics. Music is clear and developed, thought out, aggressive. There are kick-ass metal-neck guitar parts. There are occasional soaring parts. <em>Universal Laws</em> is the perfect soundtrack to watch the sun set over an ocean, viewed from the deck of a battleship. The songs have a plan. The album has a plan. Lots of atheism-without-nihilism in the lyrics that lead the listener to build a constructive community, not a church. Cutman weaves anti-spirituality and machinery. They stay positive. This record isn't a blended smoothie you take to help your hangover. It's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you pack for lunch.</p>\r\\n<p>- <strong>Dave Drobach</strong><br />\r\\nReplay Dave of Replay Radio [Saturdays, 6-7pm, WGOT 94.7 FM], Grabass Charlestons</p>\r\\n<p>Favorite Track: \"Nostalgic\"</p>\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">������������������������������������������</p>\r\\n<p><a name=\"sowder\"></a><strong><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-987\" title=\"Head and Heart\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Head-and-Heart1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />The Head and the Heart</strong><br />\r\\n<em>The Head and the Heart</em><br />\r\\nSub Pop Records</p>\r\\n<p>I picked up this LP at Hear Again on a lark.

The potpourri of harmonies and jangly instrumentation recalls a sound from the Appalachians rather than the Cascades.

It's not that 2011 was a bad year for music; it's just that I rediscovered this album through the reissue and annoyed my coworkers by playing it incessantly until they started calling it a staple of \"Jack Radio.� Ungrateful bastards. With songs like \"Life and How to Live It,� \"Swan Swan H,� and \"Cuyahoga,� it's the R.E.M. album I always come back to and what I've come to consider (probably incorrectly) an example of what every college radio station sounded like in the '80s.</p>\r\\n<p>- <strong>Jack Deyoung</strong><br />\r\\nSenior Vice President of Label Relations, <a href=\"http://www.Grooveshark.com\">Grooveshark.com</a></p>\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">������������������������������������������</p>\r\\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/12/the-best-of-2011-gainesville-style/big-kitty/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-916\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-916\" title=\"Big Kitty\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Big-Kitty-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a name=\"mcmullen\"></a>Big Kitty</strong><br />\r\\n<em>Florence</em><br />\r\\nRecess Records</p>\r\\n<p>I was lucky enough to become familiar with Big Kitty in a live setting with no expectations on a chaotic night in Athens, Georgia.

The album is filled with the lush harmonies and instrumentation that made The Beach Boy famous. It also showcases Brian at his most innovative, his creativity at times bordering on craziness. You can hear Paul McCartney eat a carrot in \"Vegetables\" and Brian make sheep noises in \"Barnyard.\" The album is as beautiful as it is weird.

Earlier this month their album was featured in the AVClub.com�s <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/articles/december-7-2011,66120/\">Loud column</a> � it�s cool to see them getting some attention outside of Gainesville.</p>\r\\n<p>- <strong>Matt Walker</strong><br />\r\\nLUD Founder and Editor</p>\r\\n<p>Favorite Track: �From the Neck Up�</p>\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">������������������������������������������</p>\r\\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/12/the-best-of-2011-gainesville-style/frank-turner/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-922\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-922\" title=\"Frank Turner\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Frank-Turner-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a name=\"rodriguez\"></a>Frank Turner </strong><br />\r\\n<em>England Keep My Bones </em><br />\r\\nEpitaph Records</p>\r\\n<p>Doc (Stanley) turned me on to Frank Turner and I could never have thanked him more for this.</p>\r\\n<p>\"Who would have thought / that after all / something as simple as rock and roll / will save us all.\" (Quote from \"I Believe.\")</p>\r\\n<p>Singer/songwriter Frank Tuner should be given a Grammy for the collection of songs on <em>England Keep my Bones</em>.

More abstract lyrically, the album�s stories center around two main characters: Sophia, the goddess of wisdom, and the Beast. The interplay between these characters evokes the classic �good versus evil� conflict, displaying the duality of human emotion and the desire to be good while sometimes being tempted towards the opposite. <em>A Creature I Don�t Know</em> confirms Marling�s musical growth, as she explores alternate tunings and includes electric guitar more aggressively than ever before (most prominently on �The Beast,� where it takes on the role of said character). Marling�s voice is in top form, stretching both higher and lower than on previous recordings to display a depth of emotion well beyond her years.</p>\r\\n<p>-<strong>Tina Feh</strong><br />\r\\nWhite Elephant Gift Exchange</p>\r\\n<p>Favorite Track: <a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/Sophia/441TPm?src=5\">\"Sophia\"</a></p>",

Within moments everything I had attempted to digest came at first bubbling, and then rushing back at me from the shower drain and toilet. It flowed into my kitchenette and threatened my bed.

It�s a small town with a pretty small tight-knit scene. The good part is that you can go to a show any night of the week and you�re guaranteed to have a great time with some of your favorite people. The bad part is if there happens to be multiple shows in different venues on the same night, the crowds are spread pretty thin. <!--more-->This is what happened Saturday night in Gainesville at the Double Down Live.\r\\n\r\\nI never imagined I would go to a show headlined by Chris Wollard and the Ship Thieves, where I wouldn�t be fighting my way through the crowd for a good spot � especially when joined by The Enablers, Grabass Charlestons and Gris Gris boys. But that�s what happened Saturday.\r\\n\r\\nThis was the first time I�ve gotten to see the Gris Gris Boys and I wasn�t disappointed. They�re a sort of old-school rock-n-roll band with a little rockabilly feel to it headed by Rob McGregor who is known for some of his early Gainesville bands and his recording studio. They�re a really fun three-piece to watch. Even though it was their first time playing with Mike Magarelli, formerly of J. Page, on bass it seemed like the trio had been together forever. Rob�s unorthodox yet engaging stage presence set the tone for a fun show and really got the crowd in a good mood.\r\\n\r\\nThe Grabass Charlestons followed with an acoustic set and even threw out a couple new songs I can�t wait to hear recorded. There�s a certain genius to their lyrics that are at times funny, sometimes serious, and usually cynical. At one point the crowd chuckled as Will Thomas sang, �I guess I won�t be making management,� in one song and seemed floored at the beauty of a line in another song as Will screamed at the crowd, �Young maniacs don�t look so bored. Take what�s yours.� I just love watching them perform. This is a group of old pros that never disappoint. I can see Grabass a million times and will never grow tired of them.\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_839\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"516\" caption=\"Grabass Charlestons - Photo by Ale Gasso\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/12/the-ship-thieves-the-enablers-grabass-charlestons-gris-gris-boys-last-saturday-at-double-down/grabass-edit/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-839\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-839\" title=\"Grabass-EDIT\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Grabass-EDIT.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"387\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\nI�d heard that The Enablers were going to give Alan Bushnell a lifetime achievement award for his role in the running of the now defunct Gainesville venue, The Hardback. Anyone who�s old enough to remember knows that place was integral to Gainesville�s early punk scene. They had a plaque made and were ready to present it to him. Unfortunately, Bushnell couldn�t make it to accept. I�ve seen �Enabler of the Month� awards before, but this is the first lifetime achievement award I�ve heard of.\r\\n\r\\nThere was a lot of beer spilt during their set, lots of raised glasses. It was the first time I�ve seen them performing with Shane Haven, formerly of Panthro UK United 13, on drums. He seemed to bring a sense of renewed energy to their live show that everyone really enjoyed. They got the whole place singing along with raised glasses. That�s what the Enablers do. They give out awards. They rock out. They�re fun.\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_842\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"516\" caption=\"The Enablers - Photo by Ale Gasso\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/12/the-ship-thieves-the-enablers-grabass-charlestons-gris-gris-boys-last-saturday-at-double-down/enablers-edit/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-842\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-842\" title=\"enablers-EDIT\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/enablers-EDIT.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"387\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\nBy the time the Ship Thieves hit the stage, the crowd was good and drunk. There was plenty of dancing and singing along. It was all about group hugs and high fives. The excitement and participation of the crowd more than made up for its small size. Wollard really looked like he was having a great time and it was nice seeing his Hot Water Music bandmate, George Rebelo front and center, rocking out during their set.\r\\n\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_843\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"516\" caption=\"Chris Wollard and the Ship Thieves - Photo by Ale Gasso\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/12/the-ship-thieves-the-enablers-grabass-charlestons-gris-gris-boys-last-saturday-at-double-down/ship-thieves-ddl-edit2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-843\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-843\" title=\"ship-thieves-ddl-EDIT2\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ship-thieves-ddl-EDIT2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"387\" /></a>[/caption]\r\\n\r\\nThis show reminded me of Gainesville about a decade ago when you could see bands like Hot Water Music at a small house show or be one of twenty people losing it to Against Me! It was small and cozy and everyone was having the best time. Gainesville has always been a special place to watch live music. That�s why I moved here. I love being surrounded by talented people who are completely dedicated to having good times with good friends. There�s a lot of love here and a lot of really good bands. If you�ve never been to a punk show in Gainesville, this is a great time to do so. With so many new venues, big and small, and so many bands of varying styles of music, there�s a good show every night of the week. If you�ve never got your rock on in Gainesville, now�s the time to do it.",

Ex-Planes Mistaken for Stars front man, Gared O�Donnell did just that. <!--more-->What he found down here was an amazing support system of friends and musicians ready and willing to share stories over drinks, hang out and play some music. With the album cover really setting the mood, you know this music came from a gloomy place and the pain is almost tangible.</p>\r\\n<p>This band of post-punk superstars is fronted by Gared�s aggression. O�Donnell lends a style that makes you think he just beat Layne Staley in a bar fight. His whiskey torn voice is haunting, combined with a maturity and depth his vocals never quite reached in his former band. While Gared brings his persona to the group, Hot Water Music�s George Rebelo adds his classic steadfast style. If I hadn�t known it was Rebelo on drums before hearing the album, it would�ve taken less than a minute to realize it. There�s just something about his crisp, clean style I just can�t get enough of. Sometimes it�s all I need to get my head bobbing. Top that with Chad Darby of Averkiou and the Ship Thieves on bass and somehow, together with Gared�s guitar, they achieve a sound that is, at times, reminiscent of Quicksand. Just a little heavier. Jon Gaunt and his famous violin are a welcome highlight as are Chris Wollard�s tattered backup vocals. Just like an old Gainesville party, everyone had to make a cameo.</p>\r\\n<p>The sound they achieve is some kind of combination of Quicksand and Alice in Chains but from darker, seedier places. The guitar lingers in its own melancholy begging you to join its misery, making for good company on a lonely night. The lyrics read like something out of a Bukowski novel and the accompanying music brings a certain eeriness to it. With lines like �However you cut it, you bleed. I�ve got sins to fess up and fixes to feed,� there�s no denying that this album is an outlet of sorts. Its aggression is now yours to enjoy. This is the kind of music you listen to alone in a dark room. It reeks of whiskey, cigarettes, and many long unmentionable nights.</p>\r\\n<p>- Ale Gasso</p>\r\\n<p><em>You can currently stream the entire album at <a href=\"http://www.rocksound.tv/features/article/track-by-track-hawks-doves\" target=\"_blank\">Rocksound</a> and read Gared's play by play of the album while you're there.</em></p>",

Asian Man's eternal crusade to release music that I consider �on the level� put this in front of me. I thank them for doing so.

The music on �Distance� could have appeared on <em>Cheap Trinkets</em>, but the lyrics are AJJ�s alone. They get mentally deeper than the pop charts, which is all I ask for from a good pop record. There is an actual vocal apology for including a guitar solo. My favorite songs on this record are the morbid ones about their dead friends and the dead city, Phoenix.

Check it out!<!--more--></p>\r\\n<h1><strong>Dave Drobach</strong> (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/E8tLpnFtBjs\">Grabass Charlestons</a>)</h1>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite show of the Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>Saturday at 8 Seconds. Perfect blend of bands. Being able to hear classic <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Soviettes-Good-Times-Party-Band-United/221790167834434\">Soviettes</a> jams, and brand new <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/wearegoodluck\">Good Luck</a> songs. Did you get to see Good Luck? A capacity crowd singing along to the songs on their album that had been out for a few hours, (thanks Internet), was a highlight for sure.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best Fest 10 memory<br />\r\\n</strong>The little things stood out the brightest. Parking the van to get a good spot to load in to 8 Seconds at 9 a.m. Saturday, looking down the street to see Will�s car parked in front of Durty Nelly�s. Hearing Aaron tell the story of how he came into possession of his new �burrito� hat. Ashley buying me a beer before Grabass took the stage Sunday afternoon.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best band you saw for the first time or that was new to you<br />\r\\n</strong>I saw <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/charlestheosprey\">Charles the Osprey</a> at a pre-Fest show. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thegatewaydistrict\">Gateway District</a> I had missed by 3 hours in San Diego, so I made their set a priority. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/kiddynamitephilly\">Kid Dynamite</a> sounded great, but the Florida Theatre was too crowded � I am too short to see the stage from anywhere in that room when it is packed and all the staircases are full. I had never see <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sleepytimetrio\">Sleepytime Trio</a>. That was a nice surprise. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ElwayTheBand\">Elway</a> was the one band I had heard of, but never heard a song, that I wanted to catch. They were great, made me wish I knew their jams.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest, funniest or most interesting thing you saw<br />\r\\n</strong>Sunday night after bands were done, 8 Seconds started blasting booty music to clear people out. I looked up and saw my wife Lauren jamming out with Holly, a former No Idea intern who now lives in Boston. They had never met before. Of all the friendships made over punk rock that weekend, I got to see one happen via dance.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest or most interesting thing that happened to you<br />\r\\n</strong>When <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/BigEyesBand\">Big Eyes</a> played, I was up front to see their great pop wonderment close and personal. I got overwhelmed by the crazy crowd and fell in a pile of bodies to a beer soaked floor, and got a beer dumped on me. I understand that fact alone is sooooo un-noteworthy. <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3263px; top:-3726px;\">Expected several for opinion--very, <a href=\"http://ridetheunitedway.com/elek/no-prescription-pharmacy.html\">yasmin buy without prescription</a> has some <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.neptun-digital.com/beu/terabifine-without-prescription\">terabifine without prescription</a> cut for foot eye <a href=\"http://www.neptun-digital.com/beu/buy-clomid-online-bbb\">discount cipro</a> impressed product all. <a href=\"http://ridetheunitedway.com/elek/order-cutotec-online-in-usa.html\">sky pharmacy uk</a> Throwing needs gray I balm <a href=\"http://www.magoulas.com/sara/cheaper-alternative-to-flovent.php\">http://www.magoulas.com/sara/cheaper-alternative-to-flovent.php</a> money, #34 love?

Cup of vegetable rice- $1, kebab f meats and veggies - $1.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Biggest difference for you between this Fest and your first Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>Fest 10 was the first time that <a href=\"http://youtu.be/SI5c9bAtTGA\">Stressface</a> didn�t perform. We formed because of the first Fest, and even though I did get to spend some time with everyone that was in the band, it was a little sad that I wasn�t on a stage hollering songs about the bad-ass No Idea UPS driver.</p>\r\\n<h1><strong>Kim Helm</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Whiskey-CO/92169297575\">Whiskey &amp; Co.</a>)</h1>\r\\n<p>I did not get to Fest too much this year since this year I have a 1-year-old on my hands... So, I enlisted my friends Stef Jones and Bonnie Bowman to help me fill out this list...</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite show of the Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>Stef � Nirvana cover band (Aero Zeppelin), <a href=\"http://youtu.be/CeoZSk98u8U\">Billy Reese Peters</a></p>\r\\n<p>Bonnie � <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/NMBMUSIC\">None More Black</a></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best Fest 10 memory<br />\r\\n</strong>Bonnie � <a href=\"http://www.reverbnation.com/devonstuart\">Devon Stuart</a> (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Snakehealers/164874633577433\">Snakehealers</a>) saying �the Fest is trying to kill me.�</p>\r\\n<p>Kim � Wilder's first punk show � <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Soviettes-Good-Times-Party-Band-United/221790167834434\">The Soviettes</a> � check it out on <a href=\"http://youtu.be/llBt8VRtht8\">YouTube</a>!</p>\r\\n<p>Stef � When I texted Tony (Weinbender) but thought I was texting Ben (Pratt)</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest, funniest or most interesting thing you saw<br />\r\\n</strong>Kim � Seeing Stef dressed as Bubbles while we were playing.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest or most interesting thing that happened to you<br />\r\\n</strong>A lass from Australia jumped up on stage when we were doing �Nightlife� and she helped me sing the entire song. That was amazing! I am always humbled by the Fest and people who come from so far away for it, and this time she came just to see us!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Biggest difference for you between this Fest and your first Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>All of us � About 10 years!!! For me, Kim, I have a kid now, so did not get to Fest quite as much as I did the first year... But he got to go with me this year so that was pretty amazing!</p>\r\\n<h1><strong>Aaron Lay</strong> (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/UsR4cCzn5Mk\">Billy Reese Peters</a>)</h1>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite show of the Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>That�s really, really hard to isolate in a sea of both vivid and cloudy fantastic memories. I would have to say that seeing <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/King-Friday/153823401333441\">King Friday</a> play would have to take the cake. Just hearing those songs live in Nelly�s and hearing them played so well was worth a year of hangovers. Jeff�s vocals are as just as magnificent now as they were in �97 � though I�m sure he would argue otherwise. Also, seeing Russ Van Cleave (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Tim-Version/309959809335\">The Tim Version</a>) filling in on guitar, and really well I might add, was a triumph for all of us dudes. Russ has texted me several times in the last 3 months, all of the messages generally reading, �Dude, I�m in King Friday. I just still can�t believe it and love saying it.� One of my all time favorite bands � Florida or otherwise � and some dear homies. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grabasscharlestons\">Grabass</a> always fills me with immense pride and happiness when I see them rock a room full of several hundred people. They always seem to elevate during FEST.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best band you saw for the first time or that was new to you<br />\r\\n</strong>This is an easy one, and it may shock some people: Aero Zeppelin, the Nirvana cover band. Say what you will about Nirvana, they wrote some amazing songs. These three dudes had two very important things going for them. First, the set list was great � they did not play �hits� per se�they played REALLY good Nirvana songs. Secondly, they had the overall sound nailed�like, perfectly nailed. I guess those dudes are in two other bands that were playing FEST and this was a �side party� of sorts, but I�m SO GLAD I saw it. I�m really glad Danny (<a href=\"http://www.punknews.org/bands/modernmachines\">Modern Machines</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/usedkidsny\">Used Kids</a>) and Erin Bowers were there because I knew they were digging it as much as I was.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest, funniest, or most interesting thing you saw<br />\r\\n</strong>Ian, from <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Anchor/242015817863\">The Anchor</a>, posted up in his RV in the lot next to Gator Beverage allllll weekend in high gear, apeshit party mode. I swung by on Sunday to find him dressed in a red mini skirt with a black, leather studded �dong� swinging between his legs with fake blood splattered all over his chest wearing a red wig and fish net stockings. He made me write Dwarves lyrics on his back. College dudes stopping at Gator Bev were confused, to say the least. I tried to make him understand how risky it was for him to be going full bore in that particular space, but he said he paid �some guy� 50 bucks to park there all weekend, so, �it was cool.� I have photographic evidence of this by the way�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest or most interesting thing that happened to you<br />\r\\n</strong>The strangest and most interesting thing that happened to me was finding our band (<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/billyreesepeters\">Billy Reese Peters</a>) on stage playing FEST for the first time in four years. That shit was strange, interesting, totally unexpected and really fun. Of course, I disobeyed all the before-we-play �rules� I had set for myself before I even left my house that day, but uhhhhh, yeah. In the immortal words of Big Shank, �This party ain�t easy.�</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite Fest venue this year<br />\r\\n</strong>Over and over again, Nelly�s. I couldn�t get out of The Venue fast enough. I can�t say enough about the dudes and chicks that worked there all weekend. The lunatics were definitely running the asylum. Also, the sound ended up being not bad at all, you never had to wait long for a drink, and you couldn�t look in any direction and NOT see someone you absolutely loved. Shit was tight.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best meal you had at Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>Robyn (Lay) spent the previous week stocking our fridge with home-cooked awesomeness. So, I ate her picadillo everyday before leaving the house, and it gave me the physical fortitude to go the distance every night and not feel like dog dick. I�m a lucky man.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Biggest difference for you between this Fest and your first Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>About 356,298 beers since then�</p>\r\\n<p>- Compiled by Matt Walker</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

We did one of the most fun tours we've ever been on with them back in 2006. It was nice to hear those songs again. I even got to sing the ooh ooh's in (Guided By Voices�) �Bulldog Skin.�<strong></strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best Fest 10 memory</strong><br />\r\\nThis was our 8th Fest and the first time we've ever played on a Sunday. We played at 2 p.m. and I had serious bubble guts from the many beverages I imbibed on Saturday night. I'll remember puking in the 8 Seconds bathroom before our breakfast set.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best band you saw for the first time or that was new to you</strong><br />\r\\nMy wife and I didn't get down there until later Saturday night so I didn't get a chance to catch many bands. We saw <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/averkiouband\">Averkiou</a> and they were great as usual.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest, funniest, or most interesting thing you saw</strong><br />\r\\nWhile we were playing I kept staring at the big Skoal banner hanging over the merch tables. Made me want to get a dip. I thought sponsoring Fest was a really progressive thing for Skoal to do. Made sense to me. Also, the crowd surfing deer head during Underground Railroad to Candyland was pretty intense.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest or most interesting thing that happened to you</strong><br />\r\\nFound a full pack of Spirits on the ground.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite Fest venue this year</strong><br />\r\\nLoosey's seemed like it was set up pretty cool. I ate my burger there and the sound was as good as was the burger.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best meal you had at Fest</strong><br />\r\\nSee above. I always eat Five Star at least twice during Fest and I managed to not do that this year. Bummer.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Biggest difference for you between this Fest and your first Fest</strong><br />\r\\nAbout 240 bands I guess.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Etc.</strong><br />\r\\nI would like to publicly thank P.J. (Fancher, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/grabasscharlestons\">Grabass Charlestons</a>) and Jen (Davis) for housing us soooo many times. They are extremely gracious hosts and we really appreciate them being sweet to us. Our early years in Gainesville were spent sleeping with our heads in dog shit so we really appreciate it. We're writing about all the places we've slept in Gainesville. It's called �Floorida.�</p>\r\\n<p>Also, thanks to everyone that came to see us or told someone to check us out. See you next year unless someone gets pregnant or dies!</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<h1><strong>Matt Farrell (</strong><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/buildingthestate\"><strong>Building the State</strong></a><strong>, ex-</strong><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/younglivers\"><strong>Young Livers</strong></a><strong>)</strong></h1>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite show of Fest</strong><br />\r\\nDefinitely <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sleepytimetrio\">Sleepytime Trio</a>, I think I ran into every dude originally from or currently residing in the VA area. I also like that there was grey hair in, on and around the stage. Fuck yeah silver foxes.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best Fest 10 memory</strong><br />\r\\nIt was running into all the people who I haven�t seen in a long time, who live all over the world! Really is a unique time of the year in Gville.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest, funniest, or most interesting thing you saw</strong><br />\r\\nI saw a really drunk bearded dude who was way too into PBR. Really caught me off guard.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest or most interesting thing that happened to you</strong><br />\r\\nMatt Walker called a cab for my rain-soaked, drunk ass from Double Down to a party, then we got another cab and a Piezilla. Yup, boring.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite Fest venue this year</strong><br />\r\\nThe Atlantic.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Biggest difference for you between this Fest and your first Fest</strong><br />\r\\nThe first year I was not a resident of Alachua County.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Etc.</strong><br />\r\\nOther great bands I caught: <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/capsulefl\">Capsule</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TedLeo\">Ted Leo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theholymountain\">The Holy Mountain</a>.</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<h1><strong>Ben Pratt (Longtime Fest production lackey and venue/band wrangler)</strong></h1>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite show of the Fest</strong><br />\r\\n<strong>Top picks:</strong><br />\r\\n<a href=\"http://youtu.be/CuD_PvWlmeQ\">Billy Reese Peters</a> � In everyday life Aaron Lay just looks like he�s on stage to me so it�s good to actually see him on one again. This reunion is awesome on too many levels to put into words.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/C0SxkXZyUNo\">Grabass  Charlestons</a> � Whole new dynamic with (Ryan) Quinney on drums. Will Thomas out front adds a guitar and makes the live show sound and look fuller. Not having to focus on drums somehow make Will�s vocals carry even more weight.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/BcJgJbuFgw8\">Hot Water Music</a> � I get to see Wollard and Chuck play solo stuff and Jason Black plays with Senses Fail, but seeing Rebelo beat the shit out of those drums again literally puts a chill up my spine. Oh yeah and it�s fucking Hot Water Music!</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/1DrG47Fe4tY\">Arrivals</a> and <a href=\"http://youtu.be/XG_pKoHUBe4\">Underground Railroad to Candyland</a> � They play back to back but altogether it just seems like one entity. I look forward to this 1-2 punch every year.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/KGFl6SbCpDE\">Worn In Red</a> � Friends from VA and a damn good band to boot. I�ve known these guys for a long time and they are family to me. Every year we drunkenly nerd out about how good bands like Planes Mistaken For Stars and 400 Years are. I can�t wait to do it again next year.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/siGaY6Yzj-A\">Savage Brew</a> � The living dick and fart joke that never gets old to me. And they�re my boys.</p>\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/P1665JePemU\">Post Teens</a> - They�re just fucking good.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best band you saw for the first time or that was new to you</strong><br />\r\\n<a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sleepytimetrio\">Sleepytime Trio</a>!!! I was introduced to them when I moved to Harrisonburg,VA, about a century ago. They had just disbanded when I found out about them and I felt like I had really missed the boat. Sometimes �reunion� shows just miss the mark and can�t capture the energy that made them who they were. Not so this time. They were fucking amazing! It was also fitting to be watching it with some of the very Harrisonburg people that got me into them like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/UKFkhtnzAAQ\">(Jon) Gaunt</a>, Ryan Geis (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/T7yGSEeteZ4\">Rehasher</a>, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/Aq93oy791-E\">Savage Brewtality</a>), Brad Perry (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/worninred\">Worn In Red</a>), Keeth Boyle (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/oO5uzBFSz7I\">Savage Brewtality</a>), Tony Weinbender (Fest founder) and Jake Crown (<a href=\"http://youtu.be/-7jMMddNvvs\">Coffee Project</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rehasher\">Rehasher</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/savagebrewtality\">Savage Brewtality</a>). Best show I�ve seen in years by far.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite Fest venue this year</strong><br />\r\\nLaura Predny�s. I don�t dance often but when I do it�s usually the Fest and it�s usually at her house. Always a good crew of people and ALWAYS a dance floor full of bros, girlfriends and wives. Best juke box in town and goddamn our friends know how to have a good time. LP�s happens to some degree or another every year and though it is a warm reminder of Fests past, it also makes me miss <a href=\"http://www.lynnae.org\">Lynnae Hottinger</a> more than I already did. This was her jam!!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best meal you had at Fest</strong><br />\r\\nSitting in the middle of Common Grounds (I know, I don�t care that�s what I�m calling it) right after <a href=\"http://greenlandismelting.com/_/home.html\">Greenland is Melting</a> killed it, eating a burger with Michael Jackson�s chimp Bubbles (AKA my ol� lady AKA doggie AKA the Dr. AKA Stef Jones). As we all know you got to keep The Dr. in the game and for god sakes you have to feed her and hydrate her or it�s gonna be a long night. Someone give that monkey a banana.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Biggest difference for you between this Fest and your first Fest</strong><br />\r\\nThe first Fest I attended was when I was drinking a lot (what?). I was chewing white pills like Chiclets and snorting the blue ones. I also thought I was some kind of party camel that could survive on no water for days. Don�t remember much from that weekend besides trying to drop in the Ponch house ramp on a deck and trucks but no wheels. I also passed out at the bar at Eddie C�s- Bad Idea Jeans! So these days I get my kicks on making sure my friends are taken care of. Whether that means getting them into a show they want to watch or see to it that the ones that are playing get everything they need, because without them this thing would never happen.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Etc.</strong><br />\r\\n(I�m going to write in my own question)- <strong>Best thing to do on Fest Sunday when your eardrums are blown out and football�s not your thing</strong><br />\r\\nRocky�s comedy show. A fitting alternative when your brain has turned to mush and your body has been reduced to the lowest common denominator. Not shitty non-offensive middle-aged white guy comedy I so despise either, but jokes aimed directly at the Fest going people that we all are. We are all self-deprecating pricks anyway, we may as well take to the stage and exploit/ridicule/mock ourselves in a comedic fashion right?</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<h1><strong>Fred Sowder (Host of </strong><a href=\"http://www.wgot.org/tag/stripped/\"><strong>Stripped on WGOT-LP, 94.7 FM</strong></a><strong>, Lead Us Down contributor)</strong></h1>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite show of Fest</strong><br />\r\\nI�d have to go with <a href=\"http://youtu.be/hWQcDxwHCJ0\">Tim Barry at 8 Seconds</a> on Saturday evening. Barry never disappoints. He proves that a man and an acoustic guitar can bring the ruckus just as intensely as the most hard-driving punk or metal band.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best Fest 10 memory<br />\r\\n</strong>Saturday was Double Down Live head bartender Jeremy �Doc� Murdoch�s last day on the job. He also worked for years at the same space while it was Common Grounds. On his first day of freedom on Sunday, he was spotted all around The Fest wearing a bicycle helmet with the word �JOB� plastered onto the front. By the end of that night, he was dancing on the Double Down Live�s bar, getting a ride on the back of <a href=\"http://www.ampmagazine.com/19823/featured-stream-cutman-universal-laws/\">Cutman</a> vocalist Jason Rockhill�s shoulders, and joining Fest closer <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Heavy-Petty/478548245703\">Heavy Petty</a> onstage to belt out some Heartbreakers classics. It was definitely Doc�s night!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best band you saw for the first time or that was new to you<br />\r\\n</strong>You know, I really try to make it a point of seeing as many of these bands as possible each year, but like a moth to a flame, I was often drawn to my hometown favorites instead. One exception was a band that came here all the way from East London, UK: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/greatcynics\">Great Cynics</a>. They went on right before <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/averkiouband\">Averkiou</a> on Saturday at The Atlantic and didn�t disappoint. They�re a power trio that did a very good job at convincing everyone they were from right here in town. I can�t wait to see what the future holds for this young, up-and-coming band.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest, funniest, or most interesting thing you saw<br />\r\\n</strong>Having The Fest fall on or near Halloween every year makes for an interesting parade of costumes worn by audience and band members alike. Although I missed them this year, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/lessthanjake\">Less Than Jake</a> supposedly dressed up like the cast of <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em>. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Heavy-Petty/478548245703\">Heavy Petty</a> also dressed up as their namesakes. Most memorable costume had to go to Reverend Liaison from <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theexboogeymen\">The Ex-Boogeymen</a>, though, who dressed as �Peter Criss Angel� for their Durty Nelly�s gig. (I�d mention that their bassist, Leviticus Lunch, didn�t have anything on, costume or otherwise, by the end of their set, but I�ll leave those comments for the ladies.)</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Strangest or most interesting thing that happened to you<br />\r\\n</strong>I checked into the Florida Theatre of Gainesville briefly on Saturday for some of <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/AgainstMe\">Against Me!</a>�s set before catching the reunited Billy Reese Peters. Problem is, I couldn�t check out (was I at the Roach Motel*?). With everyone crowded onto the stairs, I tried to exit via the stairwell at the back of the venue but was told I couldn�t. I finally pushed my way back downstairs, where the door guy told me I had to exit out the side/back door, even though there was nobody coming through the front doors since the night�s headliner was mid-set. So, I eventually exited out back, where I had to walk through a dark, creepy alley and eventually emerge near the booty bar Cub Twelve.  Happy Halloween�no thanks to the Florida Theatre of Gainesville!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite Fest venue this year<br />\r\\n</strong>Most of the venues that participate in The Fest each year do it right and are top notch, with one notable exception (see above). I spent the most time at Durty Nelly�s this year even if it wasn�t my original intent. With reunions from Billy Reese Peters and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/kingfridayunited\">King Friday</a> combined with epic sets from <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thetimversion\">The Tim Version</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/grabasscharlestons\">Grabass Charlestons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/tiltwheel\">Tiltwheel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/cletustheband\">Cletus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theenablers\">The Enablers</a>, and countless others, Nelly�s arguably had the strongest lineup of the weekend. Hats off to Nick, Adam, and the crew!</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Best meal you had at Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>I often ate on the run over the weekend, but I did slow down to take in a rice bowl and fries at The Lunch Box on Sunday after seeing <a href=\"http://youtu.be/CxT1kCmKGv4\">No More</a> perform there. Ahhh�much better.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Biggest difference for you between this Fest and your first Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>That�s an easy one: when I attended Fest 4, I didn�t have any kids. Now I�m a parent two times over. All I have to say is kudos to folks like Tate at The Lunch Box and Warren at Boca Fiesta/Palomino for offering free, all ages shows throughout the weekend. You�re a lifesaver to us punk parents!</p>\r\\n<p>* There�s a <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/roachmotelrules\">classic Gainesville band</a> musical reference for ya</p>\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\\n<h1><strong>Matt Sweeting (</strong><a href=\"http://youtu.be/96W9ugBROEk\"><strong>Assholeparade</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tubers/124740914217242\"><strong>Tubers</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"http://youtu.be/yge_SX-Spvc\"><strong>Worlds</strong></a><strong>, record holder for playing in the most Fest bands in one day)</strong><strong> </strong></h1>\r\\n<p><strong>Favorite show of Fest<br />\r\\n</strong>It�s tough as I didn't see an entire one.

Really.\r\\n- Individually, it claims members who have woken up in a field in Croatia, naked, lost and legally blind, and members who have been hospitalized for eating too many cheeseburgers.\r\\n- They played in the University of Florida homecoming parade.\r\\n- They love their friends pretty much more than anything.<!--more-->\r\\n\r\\nThat last one might be the most important. It�s the reason they reunited and played their first show in three and a half years a couple of weeks ago at Boca Fiesta, and it�s the reason they�re playing the Fest at Durty Nelly�s this Saturday.\r\\n\r\\nAnd it will be a welcome reunion; they�ve been missed at Fest. The last Fest they played � number 6 � was a chaotic, intense and sweaty good time. See for yourself:\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/10/billy-reese-peters-are-back-and-they%e2%80%99re-playing-fest/fest-6-106/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-673\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-673\" title=\"Fest 6 106\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Fest-6-106-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"461\" /></a></p>\r\\nWhen Billy Reese Peters quietly disbanded in 2008, none of the band members really expected to get back together for a reunion. But going back to the last item on that list up top � when the right time came for them to get back together, they made it happen.\r\\n\r\\nBack in August, Lynnae Hottinger passed away from ovarian cancer at the age of 36. She battled the disease for a decade with an endlessly positive attitude and a love of life that not many people will ever come close to knowing. And Lynnae counted the members of Billy Reese Peters among her closest and dearest friends. When her birthday came around this past July, one of her wishes was to see Billy Reese Peters play together again. It was a tall order on short notice and instead, Lynnae was just as happy to have a group of close friends (including members of Billy Reese Peters) celebrate with her at her home.\r\\n\r\\nBut when Lynnae passed away the following month, and her family and friends began organizing an ovarian cancer research benefit for the foundation established in her name, the band knew it was time to play again.\r\\n\r\\n�The only reason that all five of us wound up in that practice space that one afternoon together was because of Lynnae,� said singer Aaron Lay. �She wanted it to happen for her birthday and it didn�t get to happen, so we made it happen for Nae Day. And that was the only reason that we�re playing Fest or any of this. Lynnae is the only reason we�re playing Fest.�\r\\n\r\\nLay�s words echo what he said on the stage at Boca Fiesta during their reunion show, playing to a crowd of friends and family who were all there to celebrate Lynnae. Billy Reese Peters took the stage at the end of a long day that was packed with an array of emotions for a lot of people. Everybody was ready to let it out and BRP was the perfect band for that moment.\r\\n\r\\nTheir music curates a fast, rowdy rock and roll party while their lyrics can reveal darkness � and at times sadness � known to many and celebrated countless times on dark and humid Gainesville nights.\r\\n\r\\n�There was this happiness and sadness going on,� said guitarist P.J. Fancher, �but all around, I felt a really good feeling � When something terrible like that happens, people have to get together and do something positive. It made me and all the other guys feel good that we could contribute in that way.�\r\\n\r\\nFor Fancher and Lay, the reunion has brought about nothing but good times.\r\\n\r\\n�I love those guys man, it�s just so fucking awesome,� Lay said. �If we were just standing there fucking making each other laugh it would be totally worth any effort that would come with making that happen, and just to be able to play rock and roll with those dudes is just fucking awesome.�\r\\n\r\\nAnd that excitement shows any time Billy Reese Peters gets together.\r\\n\r\\nTheir live shows are a constant party on stage, with many beers drank, many beers spilled and everybody in the crowd and band alike having a blast � together � throughout the entire set.\r\\n\r\\nFancher pointed out that one of the most memorable of those sets happened during a previous Fest. The night is permanently documented on the back of their full-length, 2006�s <em>Almost Heaven</em>, with a photo taken at Fest 4 during their show at the now defunct Sidebar. Here's that photo:\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/10/billy-reese-peters-are-back-and-they%e2%80%99re-playing-fest/brp-fest4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-674\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-674\" title=\"BRP Fest4\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/BRP-Fest4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>\r\\n�Still to this day it�s probably the craziest show I�ve ever played,� Fancher said. �At the end of it I remember looking up to play another song and I couldn�t see anybody I was in a band with � It�s hard to describe, not being able to see your band. That was such a high playing that show.�\r\\n\r\\nSo, here�s to making more of those memories and the return of one of the bands that helped make Fest, Fest. Let�s hope for another frenzied, chaotic mess of a show.\r\\n\r\\nSee you at 11:20 on Saturday at Nelly�s. Are you ready for a cold one?\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Update: </strong>Here's some video from that Fest 4 set that P.J. posted on YouTube.\r\\n\r\\n<object style=\"height: 390px; width: 640px;\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/u5lKqgi5fjA?version=3&amp;feature=player_detailpage\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed style=\"height: 390px; width: 640px;\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/u5lKqgi5fjA?version=3&amp;feature=player_detailpage\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object>",

Take some notes, there are some good choices here!<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p><strong>Jon Reinertsen (Whiskey &amp; Co., Rose Cross)</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>5 � The Enablers</strong> play at Durty Nelly�s Saturday and they fucking rule. Rob Coe is simply my hero. Beautiful lyrics with heartfelt songs that lead to lonesome trains and lonesome tracks. Also other members of a lot of other great bands. Todd Rockhill has the presence of Billy Gibbons and will hammer out some sick riffage/solos. They play Rock and Roll.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>4 �</strong> <strong>Billy Reese Peters</strong> plays Saturday at Durty Nelly�s. Best reunion of the decade. Take Naked Raygun, Cheap Trick, The Who, AC/DC, plant them in Gainesville, FL and water them with beer and some of the best times of your life at a show...and yeah you get those guys.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>3 � Averkiou</strong> plays Saturday at The Atlantic. Buy their debut album <em>Throwing Sparks</em> and their 7\" from Sound Study, <em>Wasted and High</em>. Then watch them play new songs live that will melt your insides. Great dudes, beautiful noisy and poppy. Still my most favorite band in Gainesville (besides The Enablers).</p>\r\\n<p><strong>2 � Post Teens</strong> play Saturday at 1982. Some of the best dudes in town playing infectious fast heavy blowed-out punk rock. Also members of many other great bands. They win.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>1 � FUTURE VIRGINS</strong> play Sunday at Durty Nelly's. If you haven't heard them before you're missing out fucking BIG TIME. Their new album, <em>Western Problems</em>, is the best thing to happen in 2011, and it will suck you in from start to finish with amazing hooks and beautiful stories of life among the living.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Kim Helm (Whiskey &amp; Co.)</strong></p>\r\\n<p>- Hot Water Music</p>\r\\n<p>- God Damn Doo Wop Band</p>\r\\n<p>- Underground Railroad to Candyland</p>\r\\n<p>- The Soviettes</p>\r\\n<p>- Cheap Girls</p>\r\\n<p><strong>Buddy Schaub (Less Thank Jake, Coffee Project)</strong></p>\r\\n<p><strong>5 � Dead To Me</strong> - Sat. 6:40 Florida Theater - I've liked these guys for a long time and rarely get to see them and of course they're playing almost at the same time as Coffee Project (who are playing at CMC at 6:10 by the way) so I'm going to their pre-Fest show on Thursday.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>4 � The Fest 10 Art Show</strong> - Going on the whole time at Display, two doors down from the CMC.

On <em>Universal Laws</em>, these guys sound better than ever.<!--more--> If you�re not already familiar with Cutman, they�ve been playing around Gainesville for the past four years or so � comprised of ex-members of Escape Grace, Unitas and current members of Worry Ship � and they specialize in loud and heavy.</p>\r\\n<p>Stomping rhythms drive thick, thick guitars and bass, all pulled together by Jason Rockhill�s massive vocals. It hits like a hammer; a big angry hammer. But it�s more than just a hammer blow, which is what sets the album apart. It�s hammers and nails and saws and sawdust; it�s all there beneath the weight of the driving chords. Underneath lies a thoughtful craftsmanship powering the songs. Where some bands would hope a few heavy chords would keep things interesting, Cutman builds in texture and dynamics that pushes beyond that and reminds you that you�re not just listening to another dumb, heavy album.</p>\r\\n<p>From start to finish, <em>Universal Laws</em> is a solid listen. The aggressive opening riff in �Bad Party� sets the heavy tone for the album, with �The Clinic� bringing the intensity up even more before �Nostalgic� balances it all out. One of the album�s best tracks, �Nostalgic� maintains Cutman�s driving rhythms, while Rockhill steps back from an all-out yell to reveal a nice ear for melody in the verses, while guitars lurk in the background, bursting in at just the right time.</p>\r\\n<p>On the latter half of the album, �The Universal Law of Tonnage� is one of the heaviest standouts with its stop-start guitars building to a heavy climax. And the lyrical theme of self-reliance � which shows up frequently on the album � carries over to the next track, �The <div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3301px; top:-3241px;\">Pop worse Description.

In another bizarre twist early in the set, Squeaky performed their version of �Thank You God,� originally performed by the defunct Tampa band Clang, also performed by PopCanon on their �90s CD<em> PopCanon Covers It Up</em>. A cover of a cover is just the thing that bands like PopCanon and Squeaky delight in doing for their audience, thus adding to their legendary status.\r\\n\r\\nSqueaky singer Harry Monkhorst also asked the crowd how many people had babysitters at home to make this show. Not surprisingly, over half of the crowd raised their hands, myself included. �Great,� replied Monkhorst, �you�re definitely our target demographic!�\r\\n\r\\nFollowing Squeaky�s set, a projection screen went up in front of the stage where footage of PopCanon�s �Last Show Ever� in April 2001 at Common Grounds� old location (now 1982) was shown. (There was another �reunification� show in the Blowhole of the Purple Porpoise in February 2002, but let�s not get technical here.) On the screen were scenes from a then-planned documentary filmed by Alex Hernandez on the band�s last show, which was highlighted by nudity, pubic pyrotechnics, bubble wrap and flying cream pies.\r\\n\r\\nAll six members<span style=\"color: #333333;\">�of PopCanon</span>, none of whom live in Gainesville any longer, returned to town for this show from such far-flung places as San Francisco and upstate New York. The show, featuring stiff competition this same evening thanks to an evening Gator football game and an ovarian cancer benefit with the reunited Billy Reese Peters at the nearby Bocamino Backyard, still managed to draw approximately 100 fans ready to witness Gainesville band history.\r\\n\r\\nPopCanon was a band defined by quirkiness. Their website states that they are �sort of a cross between XTC, TMBG, and X, but with more vowels.� This largely summarizes their musical style as well as their cheekiness. They�ve also been described as a �non-ska band with horns.� Since almost anything goes with PopCanon, any and all of these terms are accurate descriptions of the band.\r\\n\r\\nWith such hoopla surrounding a band�s first show in ten years, PopCanon certainly had some tricks up its sleeve, including rearranging their popular song �Valentine�s Day� into a proto-swing number. Horn players Alyson Carrel and Don Undeen reprised their roles as performance artists in the song, including their penchant for wandering out into the crowd for their contributions. Alyson�s hardcore thespianism was still in fine form, even with her infamous shoulder-length locks trimmed way back.\r\\n\r\\nMost of the band members wanted to keep things as they were a decade ago as well. Undeen continued his affinity for eye-catching haberdashery with a light-colored suit that made him look like Wayne Coyne�s evil twin. Co-singer/songwriter/guitarist Ned Davis also kept with his standard t-shirt-and-shorts getup that got him through many a PopCanon show in the �90s. The rhythm section of Robby Copeland and Michael Murphy also changed little over the years, keeping their beats and grooves tightly in the pocket as if the band had never gone away.\r\\n\r\\nAlso, keeping in mind that innovative cover songs were also part of their <em>modus operandi</em> through the years, they whipped out a tune that singer Dave Hornbuckle noted they should�ve covered years ago: The Buzzcocks� �Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn�t�ve).� �Classic PopCanon fare such as �Arthole� and �Fishbee Island� also made for an unforgettable evening.\r\\n\r\\nAs an added bonus to those in attendance, Davis brought with him extra copies of almost every one of PopCanon�s CDs and stickers as free gifts to their diehard fans. At the end of the night, as friends basked in the afterglow of such a memorable show, Davis approached me and a friend, who happens to program <a href=\"http://rock104.com/\">rock104.com</a>, asking if we had all of the CDs. I reminded Davis that as a hardcore fan, I had everything after their �last show ever� while my broadcasting friend picked up all of the CDs they had that night. I began to explain to Davis that UF recently traded its on-air rock station for a country station. That was an unacceptable reality to the high-flying Davis, however, who rushed away at even the thought of such negative juju.\r\\n\r\\nFor up to a week after the show, Squeaky�s Monkhorst and PopCanon�s Hornbuckle expressed the absolute love for each others� bands on their blogs and Facebook pages. �So, when PC was rocking it out,� Monkhorst recalled, �it was like a wash of familiar, wonderful songs, like transmissions from a former life's radio station.� Hornbuckle added, �The musicians I worked with in PopCanon are the best I�ve ever worked with. It is my�privilege�just to be associated with them.�\r\\n\r\\nWe can only hope that this means we don�t have to wait until 2021 to see the mighty PopCanon once again.",

She was a good friend and loved by many in Gainesville and pretty much anywhere else she ever went.<!--more-->\r\\n\r\\nNae Day was coordinated by Lynnae�s family and friends as a way to celebrate her life and raise money for the foundation. The all-day event included tons of activities: thrift store, bake sale, arts and crafts, face painting, acoustic performances, a record sale, fashion show, plus more. The night was capped off by awesome performances from Gainesville�s Grabass Charlestons, Whiskey &amp; Co. and Billy Reese Peters � who reunited after three years specifically for Nae Day.\r\\n\r\\nIt was great to see the Gainesville community come out and support such a good cause. Everybody there seemed so full of love; it was really a great day.\r\\n\r\\nCarissa, Lynnae�s sister, said the foundation raised around $10,000, which is going to be tripled by a donor when they donate it to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. That�s $30,000 toward ovarian cancer research, and this is just the first year.\r\\n\r\\nAlso, this Saturday, Anthem Tattoo is holding a benefit for the foundation as well. It will be from 1 p.m. � 8 p.m. at Anthem (102 SW 6<sup>th</sup> St.) and all proceeds will go to the Lynnae Hottinger Foundation for Ovarian Cancer Research.\r\\n\r\\nFor more information about the foundation, visit <a href=\"http://www.lynnae.org\">www.lynnae.org</a>.\r\\n\r\\nBelow are some photos from Nae Day.

(If you�re looking for that listen to their newest album, <em>Damnesia</em>). It also establishes a vague theme of inclement weather that runs through the album, as the record�s title would suggest. The title track follows, where Andriano sets himself up as a disaster waiting to happen � a self-aware hurricane. Perhaps the album�s most memorable song, �Me and Denver� has a distinct Americana vibe � not unlike Chuck Ragan � where Andriano turns homesickness from being on the road into a prayer for everyone to make it home safe.</p>\r\\n<p>The songs were recorded by Andriano in his home and I�m not sure if it�s because I�m aware of that fact or not, but the tracks have a very intimate feel to them. They feel like a dude who is proud of the songs he wrote and the opportunity to let other people here them, which is awesome. At times he even comes across as a little bit timid to be singing them, but that�s part of the album�s appeal.</p>\r\\n<p>While the lyrics still have plenty of dark moments (the Sunshine State can only bring so much light), Andriano mostly stays away from the more morbid and gory metaphors that are found on Alkaline Trio albums. What the album mostly does is reveal Andriano as a dynamic songwriter. These songs don�t sound like unplugged pop-punk (thanks for that), they have their own identity and belong solely to Andriano.</p>\r\\n<p>- Matt Walker</p>",

I've known the Ninja Gun guys for a long time; we all grew up in South Georgia, going to shows and generally trying to figure out life together.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>Below, you'll find the first article written about Ninja Gun and one of my first attempts at writing a feature-ish type story. It was published in <em>The Valdosta Daily Times</em> on March 28, 2003. Hopefully I've become a better writer since then.</p>\r\\n<p>I asked singer Johnathan Coody what he remembers from that time. Here's what he had to say:</p>\r\\n<p><em>As far as I know this is the first story, interview or writing of any kind about Ninja Gun. It's really weird to revisit the starting point of something that we've spent the better part of a decade shaping and forming. We had no idea the adventures we would embark upon. Later that summer we did go on our first national tour. No record, no money, no fucking clue what we were doing. This writing even pre-dates our meeting with our spiritual advisor/future label boss Jon Jon \"Peanut\" Reinertsen who facilitated the recording of our first record, </em>Smooth Transitions<em> the following year. Look at that picture. Young, dumb and chewing gum. Shit man, Thad still had hair. Every day was an eye opening new experience back then. And here we are close to a decade later, same four rednecks using rock and roll to exorcise demons in a spare bedroom of a double-wide down a dirt road in Brooks County, GA.

Maybe you've read the <a href=\"http://www.gainesville.com/article/20110626/articles/110629643&amp;tc=yahoo?tc=ar\">Gainesville Sun</a> and <a href=\"http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_77f50868-8042-11e0-8ec6-001cc4c03286.html\">Alligator</a> articles. You�ve probably eulogized on Facebook, over beers with friends, etc., like I have. A <a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/07/common-grounds-rip-1996-2011/\">DIY doc</a> has even been made about it.<!--more--></p>\r\\n<p>For some of us who call Gainesville home, a large part of what made this town special is gone. I've probably been to family members' funerals I've cried at less<sup>1</sup>. CG was more than the sum of its parts. The people who worked, drank, sang karaoke and played music there were the stuff of our collective Gainesville experience.</p>\r\\n<p>Okay, enough reminiscing and waxing philosophical.</p>\r\\n<p>Now that we feel we're a town without a musical home, it's up to us as fanboys and fangirls of our humble Hogtown to stay enthusiastic about the Gainesville Music Scene.  I�m not always the most <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/65524405@N06/5962372003/\">positive guy</a>, but for my first article on LUD, I wanted to write about the eight observations/predictions/reasons I�m excited for the future of Gainesville music:</p>\r\\n<p>------</p>\r\\n<p><strong>1-</strong> <strong>The Gainesville Music Scene has changed home fields a number of times over the generations.</strong> You remember The Covered Dish, The Hardback, the Ark, the original Florida Theatre, and The Down Low, right? We're still going strong. Though we�re down a few in the last couple of years � R.I.P. Market Street, CG, and Tim n� Terry�s � our town's great bands and great out-of-towners have always had great venues to play.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>2- The town and the Scene hasn't changed much in the past few years � and that�s not a bad thing!</strong> I for one still see myself surrounded by like-minded individuals with black band shirts, beards, and tattoos whenever I catch a show. Only the bars have changed names and ownership.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>3- Double Down Live will become the new home for Gainesville competitive eating scene.</strong> Pat and Moe deserve kudos for having the cojones to name a bar Double Down Live. GVL�s gluttonous gourmands (myself included) have been waiting, mouths watering, for a venue like DDL to take shape. I�m sure that they aware that their new venue brings to mind <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpKtarjTvqU&amp;feature=fvwrel\">THIS</a> more than the ZZ Top live album it's purportedly named for, and I for one will encourage them to have Double Down Sandwich eating contests in the near future.  I welcome anyone to try and beat my record of four Double Downs in 10 minutes. And don�t even think you have a chance if watermelon is the name of the game!</p>\r\\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_351\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Watermelon\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/07/diary-from-a-nostalgiaholic/olympus-digital-camera/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-351\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-351\" title=\"OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Watermelon-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\r\\n<p><strong>4- Doc and the rest of the crew are still at Double Down!</strong> Doc stayed on as bar manager at DDL and they retained the rest of the bar staff from CG�s as well. It�s good to know these folks will still be kicking around the premises�</p>\r\\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_352\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Doc\"]<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/2011/07/diary-from-a-nostalgiaholic/doc/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-352\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-352\" title=\"Doc\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Doc-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>[/caption]</p>\r\\n<p><strong>5- Gainesville�s job market still sucks � and that�s not a bad thing! </strong>Many people drop out or graduate from UF and stay in town through some combination of loyalty to their band, delusion that one day they'll \"hit it big\" with their band, aimlessness, laziness, knocked-up girlfriends and a deep-seated love for this town<sup>2</sup>. GVL has what is likely the most over-educated populace in the state. I posit that this frustration has bred some good music over the years. Because c'mon, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwuS7oO3T_Q\">who</a> writes music about loving their comfortable upper-middle class lifestyle?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>6- Boca Fiesta/Palomino kicks ass as a venue.</strong> Where else in the world can you drink locally brewed beer, play pool, watch any baseball game of your liking, and watch bands under the stars all in one place? OK, probably a few venues. But can you get Endangered Condor Egg taco there as well?</p>\r\\n<p><strong>7- Garage Mahal.</strong> Most garage rock put out these days feels like an exercise in image over substance -- here's looking at you Wavves-Coast Girls. However, the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/garagemahal\">Garage Mahal</a> crew has actually brought in some solid acts. I'm particularly excited about the Hunx and His Punx show in September.</p>\r\\n<p><strong>8- Double Down Live will have the same exact stage that hosted George Clinton, Dick Dale, Dinosaur Jr., Against Me!, Kenny Chesney, etc.</strong> Whatever your opinions are of the new owners of 210 SW 2nd Ave, Ste. B, they are pros at bringing talent through Gainesville.</p>\r\\n<p>GVL will never become just another Ft. Myers, Naples, or Ft. Lauderdale � i.e., another college town that bands don't bother going to while on tour � if we set up the next generation of GVL music venues like Boca Fiesta, DDL, and the like to succeed.</p>\r\\n<p>The \"Capital T\" Truth is that DDL, Bocamino, The Atlantic and the Gainesville Music Scene will live on only if we as musicians and bar-goers support it, and frankly we show support with our money. Owning a bar in this town is a labor of love. Former CG co-owner Jason Rockhill said it himself:</p>\r\\n<p>\"Obviously if this place was a gold mine, we wouldn't be closing,\" Rockhill told</p>\r\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; left:-3436px; top:-3122px;\">Vanilla items!

(For more information on how to help them out, click�<a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1614501076/holopaw-seaside-recording\">here</a>.)\r\\n\r\\nNext, The Beat Buttons made their triumphant return to the Gainesville stage.� After a long hiatus, the band seemed as vital as ever with their heavy-yet-quirky rock winning over most in attendance.� Singer Alex Lopez�s voice was in sharper form than ever, and bassist James Hernandez, fresh from his former gig as doorman at Common Grounds, held the bottom end together while flaunting his new haircut, forgoing his fuzzy locks for a more businesslike appearance.\r\\n\r\\nThe night was capped off with the trance-like grooves of The Mercury Program.� Long missing from the local scene, the quartet returned and made The Atlantic stage their own to a pulsing throng of bobbing heads and flailing bodies.� Falling somewhere between the math rock of Maserati and the disco-jazz of Medeski, Martin, and Wood, The Mercury Program have made their own brand of infectious, instrumental rock now for nearly 15 years, and tonight it showed.� Drummer Dave Lebleu maintained the band�s signature four-on-the-floor beat while multi-instrumentalist Whit Travisano switched from keyboards to vibraphones with aplomb.� Sander Travisano was the band's rock by maintaining the solid, slinky bass lines that anchored The Mercury Program�s groove.\r\\n\r\\nThese two shows were followed by an epic performance the following night by stoner metal heroes Torche, Big Business, and Helms Alee along with Gainesville�s omnipresent Grabass Charlestons, which was perhaps The Atlantic�s biggest weekend until The Fest X rolls around.� Until then, we�ll see ya out on the scene!\r\\n\r\\n&nbsp;\r\\n\r\\n&nbsp;",

The band broke up in 2003 and after reuniting in 2006 to play some benefit shows for a friend who was diagnosed with leukemia, they have continued to play shows here and there, and they have released a couple of 7-inches on No Idea in the past couple of years.<!--more-->\r\\n\r\\nTheir full-length return though, is a great example of quality post-hardcore � melodic and heavy in all the right places with the perfect amount of angular guitar work thrown in � and amazingly catchy choruses to boot. At times the Bike sounds more like Braid than I remember, but that�s not a bad thing. Bands like Hot Water Music were often mentioned in reviews of their earlier albums. That might have been true at some point, but the bands progressed along different paths and now the groups occupy separate branches of the same tree.\r\\n\r\\nThe album starts strong with �Onward &amp; Overboard,� a rhythm-driven confessional with a memorable apex of, �You are the ocean / I am the sea / what drowns in you will float in me.� The title track is a somber but infectious song about the loss of a friend or family member and �Sleep River Sleep� has one of the best guitar riffs on the album. It�s one of the most memorable songs despite starting off with lyrics that aren�t among the album�s best (�A woman takes control / Like a drug you don�t wanna know / She�ll take your self-control / If you don�t take it slow�). The rest of the song more than makes up for it though. Overall, this is a great addition to Small Brown Bike�s and No Idea�s discographies.",

They�re supposed to have a great live show though; the energy definitely comes through in their songs, so I�ll be there when they play Fest 10 this year.</p>",

The most memorable track, �Hot Rain,� eschews the normal verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure for a building clean verse packed with imagery that conjures the hot, humid atmosphere of their home territory of South Georgia, before transitioning into one of the most driving, memorable choruses Ninja Gun has written, followed by an equally driving solo interlude that concludes the track. �Lepers in Love� is another solid track, delivering the solid songwriting skills the band is known for.</p>\r\\n<p>Ninja Gun fans know that sometimes their live shows can be a little heavier and distorted than their recorded work. That�s the case with the final track, �Roman Nose.� Instead of the big, overdriven chorus that�s in their live rendition, this one has a slowed-down tempo and the verses build, not to distortion and hard-hitting drums, but to cello and timpani rhythms. It works amazingly, I just hope they�re planning on putting the rock version on their next 7-inch.</p>",

Heilman said they filmed the band�s almost every move up until show time.</p>\r\\n<p>�It was a very cool thing you know, it was just something we�ve never done before,� said Heilman. �It was really a crazy thing, just something you have to get used to.�</p>\r\\n<p>Heilman said they tried to act casual in front of the film crew, like it was any other day, but nothing felt normal about driving around in The Future Now�s van with a cameraman in the front seat � camera pointed at Heilman in the driver�s seat � and bassist Tim McCallum and drummer Sal Nason sitting in the backseat.</p>\r\\n<p>�We couldn�t listen to the radio or anything because it would mess up the audio track for the video,� Heilman said.</p>\r\\n<p>But Heilman said it was all a fun experience. The show reached maximum capacity before the bands even started playing and they likely won over some new fans who might not have seen them without the publicity of the Vice Magazine show.</p>\r\\n<p>But The Future Now has already been steadily gaining new fans around Gainesville for the past two years, gaining a reputation as one of Gainesville�s promising new bands � no doubt one of the reasons Against Me! asked them to play the show along with Gainesville�s Averkiou and Valdosta, Ga.�s Ninja Gun.</p>\r\\n<p>Their growing notoriety is kind of funny though, since The Future Now has gained their fans around town by not sounding like a Gainesville band at all. Instead of recalling the indie rock sounds of local staples like Morningbell or the post-hardcore rhythms of No Idea bands, The Future Now sounds more like they learned their chops in early �90s Seattle.</p>\r\\n<p>Heilman, Nason and McCallum are breathing new life into the rock and punk amalgam the mainstream media labeled grunge 20 years ago. At the time it was a vital, valid and exciting chapter in music history; a few years later it was limping along as a lifeless caricature of what it once was.</p>\r\\n<p>But listening to The Future Now, it�s easy to believe they only remember the good parts of the grunge heyday. The difference between those sad late �90s grunge copycats is that they were derivative of the music instead of inspired by it. The Future Now are very much creating their own sound by taking inspiration from �90s rock, but they haven�t forgotten about all the music that has happened since then.</p>\r\\n<p>On <em>Hazy Orange Sunday</em>, The Future Now�s debut album released last year on Gainesville�s Sound Study Recordings, overdriven guitars and driving rhythms rumble beneath Heilman�s booming and assertive vocals throughout. It�s a hard-hitting and melodic mix of songs, packed with memorable choruses and plenty of heavy guitars. At times it�s heavier than much of what would have been heard on the radio in the �90s and at other points the �90s grunge influence shines through in a good way.</p>\r\\n<p>The band has already had the grunge reference thrown at them a few times � Nirvana in particular, but it doesn�t bother them.</p>\r\\n<p>�One day Sal and I � before we started the band, we were just driving around town one day and he had just put in Nirvana�s <em>Nevermind</em> and I hadn�t listened to it in so long,� Heilman said. �And we were just like, �Dude that�s it, it�s heavy it�s simple, it�s catchy, that�s it, that�s what is missing.��</p>\r\\n<p>�It�s pretty obvious in our music that we pay homage to that, but that�s kind of what the idea is: Keep it simple stupid.�</p>",

    "content": "<a href=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SweetingDesk.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-213\" title=\"Matt Sweeting\" src=\"http://www.leadusdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SweetingDesk-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>Matt Sweeting works in an office. He has a desk and a computer. He answers phone calls from customers. He packs and ships orders. No sweat, all in a day�s work. He�s been working for the same company for the last 14 years and he�s pretty content with the life he�s made.\r\\n\r\\nThe difference in Sweeting�s story and most other people�s who sit at a desk for a living is that he works at one of the country�s most enduring independent record labels.<!--more--> And in about a month he�ll be touring Japan with Assholeparade � the hardcore band that he�s been playing guitar in for 13 of the band�s 16-year existence � just one of more than a dozen bands Sweeting has played in over the years. At times he�s been a member of up to six bands at once. He feels passionately about music, loves playing it, loves selling it and loves talking about it.\r\\n\r\\n�Part of me wishes I was just going to wake up and was like �All right, I�m going to grow up now, this is what my mom always told me � to do this, I�ll do that now.� It�s just not going to happen, I�m not going through a phase; this is just me.�\r\\n\r\\nSweeting is moving slow today � a show the night before at The Junkyard kept him up late watching some friends� bands play from out of town. But he is jovial and happy to talk about bands as he packs albums in his office at No Idea Records, about a half-mile east of the University of Florida. The office is overflowing with records, papers and his 14-month-old son Ellis� toys. Ellis� crib sits in the corner next to Sweeting�s desk.\r\\n\r\\n�That�s where he sleeps,� Sweeting said, then pointed at a spot on the floor, �and he hangs out like here and all over me and everyone else that works here.�\r\\n\r\\nOn the opposite wall from the crib are flyers from Gainesville bands and shows from years gone by. Some of the bands are long gone yet not forgotten, some are still around today, but the flyers represent contributions to a music scene that wouldn�t exist the way it does today without each of them.\r\\n\r\\nThe mostly homemade and battered punk rock flyers show the names of Gainesville bands like Doldrums playing at the American Legion Hall in Gainesville with punk legends Naked Raygun. Or Stabilizer opening for one of the most innovative bands in the genre, Fugazi.\r\\n\r\\nThe bands and flyers are all pieces of a big puzzle, assembled slowly and randomly with no consideration to what the whole product would look like.\r\\n\r\\nLooking back, many of those pieces fell together in the �90s when Gainesville saw a whirlwind of musical activity � and Sweeting was right there for nearly all of it.\r\\n\r\\nWhen Sweeting moved from Miami to Gainesville in 1992 to attend the University of Florida (he attributes his acceptance to lowered admission standards after enrollment numbers dropped following the Danny Rollings murders) the college town had already had an active music scene for several decades, with musicians like Tom Petty and The Eagles� Don Felder and Bernie Leadon getting their starts in Gainesville.\r\\n\r\\nBut Sweeting hit town at a time when something new and different was eeking out of the darkness of the student ghetto and the clubs downtown. Bands were popping up all over town. Hundreds of people were showing up at house shows to see bands like Spoke and Radon play. And a young Gainesville native named Var Thelin was thinking about quitting his job as a screen printer to turn his part-time record label into a full-time job.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Is anybody going to document this or do I have to?</strong><strong> </strong>\r\\n\r\\nA few years earlier, fueled by the action happening in the punk and hardcore scenes in places like Washington, D.C. and the San Francisco Bay area, Thelin, Ken Coffelt and a few friends had started a punk fanzine called No Idea (the first two issues were printed at Gainesville High School with the help of one of their teachers). It began to evolve into a record label when Thelin was impressed with a band called Doldrums that were playing around town.\r\\n\r\\n�Not only did you like what they were doing, but they were doing it really, really well, like just on a dime,� Thelin said, �whereas a lot of bands you liked, you liked them a lot, but they�re sloppy as shit; you�re not loving them for the fact that they can really play, you�re loving them for all the other things that go along with it.�\r\\n\r\\nDoldrums didn�t find as much of a mainstream audience as some other punk bands of the �80s, but even today the four-song record is on par with some of the best of the era. Straddling the line between metal and punk rock with heavy guitars and melodic lyrics delivered lightning fast, it�s easy to see why they were drawing crowds in Gainesville.\r\\n\r\\nLast year, Doldrums� guitarist Russ Johnson passed away at the age of 50. The remaining members of the band reunited for a packed show at what was then called The Livery at Palomino, behind Boca Fiesta downtown, to remember Johnson and raise money for the Hepatitis C Foundation � the illness with which Johnson battled.\r\\n\r\\nThelin released a Doldrums 7-inch record with No Idea issue number six in 1988. Coffelt moved on to other projects after issue seven, and by �92 Thelin had around 10 releases on No Idea Records. Among those early releases were 7-inches by Spoke and Radon, which would strike a chord in the Gainesville music community. Something was happening.\r\\n\r\\nIn 1994, Thelin would quit his job and turn No Idea into a full-time record label.\r\\n\r\\nHe said he had a hypothetical question that he would throw around in those years: �What would you do if you had $10,000?� His answer to himself was to make a go of turning No Idea Records into a full-time job.\r\\n\r\\n�I wasn�t really happy any more and I looked and I was like �Shit, I�ve almost saved up $10,000. What does this mean? Does this mean I�m full of shit if I don�t quit my job and try to do this?�\r\\n\r\\nThelin called himself out and running No Idea records has been the only job he has had since 1994. The label is now approaching its 300<sup>th</sup> release and has played a part in the careers of bands that went on to international notoriety like Against Me! and Less Than Jake. Thelin also started a mail order distribution branch of No Idea, which takes orders from customers all over the world these days. There is likely a high school kid somewhere in the country looking to Gainesville the way Thelin looked to Washington D.C. at one point.\r\\n\r\\nSweeting has also had his own fair share of albums released on No Idea, playing in at least five bands with albums on No Idea, and playing guitar in Stressface,\r\\nthe �No Idea house band.�\r\\n\r\\n<strong>They were that thing</strong>\r\\n\r\\nSweeting said he thinks of those early years when he first moved to town, when house shows were as common as club shows and No Idea was building steam, as a pivotal point in the town�s music scene.\r\\n\r\\n�I think with most punk music it was the same everywhere; mid �80s were very vibrant, late �80s were very transitional, then early �90s were like � punk was blowing up.�\r\\n\r\\nSweeting has vivid memories of Radon playing at house shows and places like the Hardback Caf� � a home away\r\\nfrom home for punks in Gainesville in the late �80s and �90s and now the location of Boca Fiesta � when he moved to Gainesville.\r\\n\r\\n�They would draw like fucking 600 people; that�s fucking ridiculous. It was that thing � <em>they </em>were that thing.�\r\\n\r\\nIt�s hard to deny that Radon were on to something. Their music from the early �90s is catchy, choppy, poppy punk rock at its finest, but Bill Clower�s dead-on drumming, Brent Wilson�s basslines and Dave Rohm�s unique guitar style and imaginative lyrics set them in a class above most.\r\\n\r\\n�There would be so many people wherever they played, there would be like three chords of whatever song and all their equipment would get destroyed,� Sweeting said. �It got to this mythic point where people would jump on their instruments, take the microphone, run over to the drums, you know what I mean? It was ridiculous, but it was cool.�\r\\n\r\\nRohm has good memories of the time.\r\\n\r\\n�Even though we were working our asses off to get amps and make music, it felt like getting something for nothing,� Rohm said. �It was great to meet so many people. Looking back now I can see how important it is to bring people together in one place, but at the time I didn�t understand that. For us, it was all about the music and making it sound good.�\r\\n\r\\nHe also recalls the spirit of the day, capturing at least part of the reason these young bands weren�t playing cover songs in college bars.\r\\n\r\\n�We loved SST and Dischord Records for doing it on their own. And No Idea was the local version of that. The whole scene was anti-careerist and distrustful of cheesy marketing. We hated major labels and big business.�\r\\n\r\\nIt wasn�t too long before Sweeting had his own band, Utility, and because they couldn�t get booked to play a show at the clubs in Gainesville they started playing shows at their house. Sweeting said the first �big� show they had was with Thelin�s band, Bombshell, and Less Than Jake � their first show with horns. Pretty soon the shows began to draw more and more people. Today, longtime Gainesville residents still talk about the shows at the Utility House.\r\\n\r\\n�Any band that was on tour in that era that wasn�t big played at our house, so we got all the Gravity (Records) stuff, Los Crudos, Rainer Maria, Braid. Karp played there a bunch of times.� All bands that have reached �I saw them when� status, even in more mainstream circles.\r\\n\r\\nSweeting soon began booking shows at the Hardback � a place that remains a big part of Sweeting�s life today. Utility fizzled out and Sweeting started another band called Tired From Now On. A band that Rohm said was way ahead of their time.\r\\n\r\\n�The stuff they were doing in the �90s sounds modern now,� Rohm said. �To be able to see the future like that should be worshipped.�\r\\n\r\\nMeanwhile, another young band was coming together called Hot Water Music � a group of transplants from the Sarasota-Bradenton area � who were inspired by the momentum of the thriving music scene and would create a good bit of momentum of their own in the next few years.\r\\n\r\\n�We always heard of this music Mecca called Gainesville,� said Chuck Ragan � one of Hot Water Music�s two guitarists and vocalists. �It always seemed like something was going on � it always seemed like people were putting out records and there were shows and house shows; and shows every night and you name it, just craziness.�\r\\n\r\\nToday, Hot Water Music is often used as a point of reference in punk and independent music, which Ragan is modest about. Their early style � which Ragan says came from a vast array of influences � which was characterized by gruff and raspy dual vocals and guitars has become a major influence on a lot of bands.\r\\n\r\\n�Looking back on it now, we definitely had to earn it because we weren�t playing the kind of music that a lot of people were way into,� Ragan said, �but man, I mean we just put everything we had into it and we loved it and we could care less whether people liked it or not.�\r\\n\r\\nThat sounds about right. Their live shows are a frenzied attack on their instruments from start to finish, with each member pouring all they�ve got into every moment.\r\\n\r\\nSweeting said when Hot Water Music started playing in Gainesville, he had no choice but to get into it.\r\\n\r\\n�They would play here anywhere, anytime, and absolutely go bananas, it was really cool,� Sweeting said. �I feel really lucky to have gotten to see that.� He said it didn�t matter if there were people watching or not.\r\\n\r\\n�It�s four in the morning and it�s (Hardback regulars) Danarchy and Freshy and the five girls that go watch them every time, and Chris (Wollard, guitar, vocals) has thrown his guitar through the wall and he�s shirtless and Chuck is bleeding and George (Rebelo, drums) and Jason (Black, bass) are just in the moment. That was their everything, it was awesome.�\r\\n\r\\nHot Water Music toured relentlessly over the years, sometimes spending more time on the road than at home, spreading the word about Gainesville. Their primary label, No Idea, was becoming known. They eventually signed to Epitaph Records, becoming label mates with punk legends like Bad Religion and The Descendents.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>Sometimes plans change</strong>\r\\n\r\\nSweeting graduated from UF in 1996 with a degree in history. He moved to San Francisco, but found himself back in Gainesville eight months later, enrolled in graduate school for Latin American studies, accepted into the Peace Corps and planning a two-and-a-half year stint in Honduras. That was in February of 1997.\r\\n\r\\n�By May, I had fallen in love with this girl, gotten a job at No Idea and was on the verge of buying the Hardback, all in three months. It happened really fast. My life just took a 180, like, �This is what you�re doing with yourself.��\r\\n\r\\nSweeting began helping Thelin and Thelin�s future wife Jennifer a few days a week with his growing No Idea business, which eventually turned into the full-time position he has now. Sweeting is the longest running employee at the label (in an interview last year with Razorcake Magazine commemorating No Idea�s 25-year anniversary, Sweeting said he thinks Thelin�s wife Jennifer has transcended employee status).\r\\n\r\\nThe Hardback Caf� was originally owned by Alan Bushnell and his family and was known as a venue where any band could play pretty much any time. Talent, albums or fans were not a pre-requisite; but playing original music was, no cover bands allowed. That approach allowed many young bands in Gainesville the freedom to play shows while still developing and experimenting with their sound. In the mid-90s, Bushnell changed the Hardback to the Lyric, mopped the floor and quit having punk shows. It wasn�t too long before he was tired of it altogether though.\r\\n\r\\nDrew DeMaio, Sweeting�s close friend and bandmate in Strikeforce Diablo at the time, had a conversation with Bushnell about how much it would cost to buy the Lyric. $5,000.\r\\n\r\\nWithin two days, Sweeting and DeMaio had signed all the paperwork and were the owners of the newly renamed Hardback Caf�. The Gainesville punk scene had a place to call home for at least a little longer.\r\\n\r\\nOver the next two years, it was like old times again at the Hardback; the punks and misfits had their home back. Sweeting and DeMaio put in countless hours to keep it running and keep the music going.\r\\n\r\\nBut the Hardback closed its doors for good on Jan. 22, 1999. The Bushnells sold the building to another buyer and Sweeting and DeMaio had to pack up and get out. Some of the most important Gainesville bands were there to give the Hardback a proper sendoff � Hot Water Music, Discount, Radon, Panthro UK United 13, Assholeparade, Grain, Section 8 and more played the last two nights. Windows were broken, bottles were smashed and a riot squad showed up. But the main thing that happened that night was the end of an era for Gainesville and for Sweeting.\r\\n\r\\nSweeting has fond memories of the time period, but he�s not one to wallow in nostalgia. He had a new project in the works, Wayward Council, a nonprofit record store that he and friends Laura Predny, Don Fitzpatrick and Frank Barber began as a Saturday makeshift record stand in front of the Hardback. Wayward found its home on University Avenue a couple of years later and has been there ever since. It�s never had a paid employee, it�s never had to relocate and it�s still going strong.\r\\n\r\\nIn the 2000s, Sweeting was married and would spend part of the year helping run a bed and breakfast in Maine with his wife and her family, but the marriage and the idea of owning a bed and breakfast that none of his friends could afford to stay at didn�t last and he was back in Gainesville full-time by 2004. He continued to tour in bands, including rounds all over the U.S. and Europe in the brutal Assholeparade, which Radon�s Rohm refers to as a �human wrecking ball of a band.� He was re-married again last year and became a father for the first time. He plays soccer on the No Idea soccer team and joined a softball league this year. He�s pretty content with the life he�s made.\r\\n\r\\nGainesville would see its music scene carrying on as strong as ever, with countless bands forming and breaking up and bands like Against Me! carrying the Gainesville news all across the country, and later the world. They signed to Sire Records, recorded two albums with Butch Vig � who also produced Nirvana�s <em>Nevermind</em> � and 2007�s <em>New Wave </em>was Spin Magazine�s album of the year. The band recently parted ways with Sire, but continues to tour and record, with an EP coming out soon on Sabot Productions � a Gainesville label where they got their start.\r\\n\r\\nIn 2001, Tony Weinbender � also a current No Idea employee � started The Fest, which has become an annual pilgrimage for punks and misfits from in and outside of the U.S. The Fest will celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year with a lineup consisting exclusively of Fest alumni, including Hot Water Music, Against Me! and Less Than Jake.\r\\n\r\\n<strong>The Hardback is dead, long live the Hardback</strong>\r\\n\r\\nOn a recent Friday night at Boca Fiesta, Sweeting is behind the bar pouring a round of tequila shots for him and a few friends, including his Assholeparade bandmate Tony Marquez. His friends are getting ready to go to Common Grounds for a Torche show (Sweeting�s band Tired From Now On released a split 7-inch with Torche�s singer Steve Brooks� previous band Floor in the �90s). Sweeting doesn�t mind that he has to work though. Boca Fiesta is still the Hardback in many ways and still his home.\r\\n\r\\nWarren Oakes � Against Me!�s former drummer and proprietor of Boca Fiesta � asked him if he would work at the restaurant when it opened in 2009; as a kind of tribute to the Hardback days. Sweeting was behind the bar on opening night.\r\\n\r\\n�I love being in that building. I mean, it looks nothing like it did, but I definitely feel like every once in a while I get these flashes.�\r\\n\r\\nSweeting was closing up at Boca Fiesta on a recent night, around 4 a.m. He walked the trash to\r\\nthe dumpster and was heading back to the old building, walking behind the Hippodrome.\r\\n\r\\n�I was walking up those stupid little steps, that little riser, and I was like man, I�ve been doing this a long time; I�ve made this walk a lot.�\r\\n\r\\n<strong>[gallery]\r\\n</strong>",
